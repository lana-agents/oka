"""Report which declarations a module docstring advertises as main results and nothing guards.

`OkaTest/Axioms/` is this repository's regression test that the library rests only on `propext`,
`Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`.  `OkaTest/Axioms.lean` states a **placement** rule — which
file, which heading — and says nothing about which declarations ought to be guarded, so a reader
is entitled to think the guards are complete.  They are not, nothing measured how incomplete, and
this is the measurement.

Usage:

    python3 scripts/guard_coverage.py                 # the report
    python3 scripts/guard_coverage.py --by-file       # ...with every gap listed by file
    python3 scripts/guard_coverage.py --self-test
    python3 scripts/guard_coverage.py --dump FILE     # reuse a declaration dump
    python3 scripts/guard_coverage.py --env-dump FILE # ...and reconcile against `DumpEnvNames`

It runs `lake env lean scripts/DumpOkaDecls.lean` unless `--dump` is given, so the build must
have run first: it reads the oleans, it does not produce them.

**This is a reporter and not a gate, and it must not be wired into `.orchestra/validation.sh`.**
The correct number of unguarded results is not zero, nobody has decided what it should be, and a
check that fails on the current tree is a check somebody will disable.  `scripts/import_cost.py`
is the model, and its docstring gives the reason in a sentence: *"the cost itself is output, not a
verdict, because the figures live in English prose and nothing can check them mechanically."*
Exit is 0 whatever the coverage is, and non-zero only when an argument is wrong, the dump cannot
be built, or the self-test fails.

## The defect this exists to stop

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.sigmaι_sigmaDesc` was added to `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Sigma.lean`'s
`## Main results` by lana-agents/oka#191 — which was itself taking a reviewer's note that the list
was missing it — **without the matching guard**, and the two lists then disagreed by exactly one
entry.  It was caught by a reviewer reading both lists by eye, routed to taxis #1051 and fixed in
lana-agents/oka#194.  Nothing mechanical would have caught it.  The argument that settled it was a
precedent inside the same guard file: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ι_glueMorphisms` was already
guarded and stands to `glueMorphisms` exactly as `sigmaι_sigmaDesc` stands to `sigmaDesc`.  That
is a good argument about one declaration and it does not scale.

## What is counted, and it is not what a prefix test would count

*Guarded* is a `#print axioms <name>` command under `OkaTest/Axioms/`, with comments masked.
*Advertised* is a backticked token inside a `## Main results` section of a **module** docstring
under `Oka/`, kept when it names a declaration this repository owns.

Ownership is read from `scripts/DumpOkaDecls.lean`, which asks Lean which module declared each
constant.  A prefix test on the name would be wrong in both directions: this repository declares
into `AlgebraicGeometry`, `CategoryTheory` and `Polynomial` from its mirror tree — those names
have nothing beginning with `Oka` about them — and a `## Main results` section may cite a Mathlib
declaration in a namespace this repository also declares into.  So `AlgebraicGeometry.…` alone
decides nothing, and the dump is what separates the two.

## Four things it cannot see, in decreasing order of how much they matter

* **A main result named in prose and not backticked is invisible**, so the *advertised* figure is
  a lower bound on what the docstrings claim.  `Oka/Weierstrass.lean`'s `localweierstrass_division`
  is backticked and guarded and so lands in the overlap; a result described in words is not
  counted at all.
* **It has no opinion about whether a name ought to be guarded.**
  `Oka/Analytic/ParametricCircleIntegral.lean` is general complex analysis with a Mathlib
  destination and guarding all 17 of its advertised results may well be the wrong call.  The
  number is a measurement and the judgement is a human one; see `OkaTest/Axioms.lean`.
* **The reverse direction is not a defect.**  A guard on a lemma no docstring advertises is fine
  and there are many; the count is printed because it is the other half of the divergence, not
  because anything should be done about it.
* **A `## Main results` list can advertise a declaration that lives in another file.**  That is
  legitimate — a file may be the natural place to announce a result it re-exports — and the
  report says how many such entries there are rather than treating them as errors.

## Why the instrument gets its own self-test

`scripts/import_cost.py` records that the obvious instrument for *its* question "was written
wrong twice, by two different agents, and both wrong figures passed the project's standard
validation."  This is the same species: a count over docstrings, produced once, quoted afterwards
in prose that nothing checks.  The failure that actually happened here is on this issue's own
thread — the first version of taxis #1057 gave five figures that were all correct about the tree
they were taken on, which was the filer's branch and not `master`.  **A number can be right and
its description wrong**, and no self-test can catch that one; what `--self-test` does catch is the
extraction, which is the part with a wrong answer that looks like a right one.

Both halves are pinned with a control, so neither check can go vacuous: the masking fixture
asserts that the unmasked regex *does* find the thing masking removes, and the module-docstring
fixture asserts that the same text in a `/--` declaration docstring is *not* read as a list of
main results.
