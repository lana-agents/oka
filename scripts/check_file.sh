#
# This exists because `lake env lean FILE.lean` **does not apply `lakefile.toml`'s
# `[leanOptions]`**. That is measured, on three of the block's five entries; *why* it does not is
# not measured and no explanation should be read into this comment. What reproduces, 2026-08-23:
#
#   * a 102-character docstring line: `lake env lean` prints nothing and exits 0; with
#     `-Dweak.linter.mathlibStandardSet=true` it reports `This line exceeds the 100 character
#     limit`;
#   * `theorem t (x : Foo) : True := trivial` for an undefined `Foo`: `lake env lean` exits 0 and
#     warns only about `x`; with `-DautoImplicit=false` it is `Unknown identifier 'Foo'`;
#   * `#check fun x : Nat => x`: `lake env lean` prints `fun x => x`, and with
#     `-Dpp.unicode.fun=true` it prints `fun x ↦ x`. This third one is not about linting at all,
#     which is why it is here — it says the *block* is not in effect rather than that some linter
#     is off.
#
# So "`lake env lean` was silent" is not evidence that a linter passed — it is evidence that no
# linter ran. This script reads the options out of `lakefile.toml` at run time rather than
# hardcoding them, because a stale copy of that list would reintroduce exactly the drift it
# exists to remove.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THIS IS NOT `validation.sh`, AND A GREEN RUN HERE IS NOT EVIDENCE THAT ANYTHING COMPILES.
#
# It does not run:
#
#   * `lake exe mk_all --lib Oka --check` — a new file missing from `Oka.lean`;
#   * `lake lint` (`runLinter`) — the *environment* linters: `docBlame`, `simpNF`,
#     `defsWithUnderscore` and about ten more, which check the whole environment and not one file;
#   * `lake exe lint-style` — the text linters (trailing whitespace, disallowed unicode, module
#     name casing);
#   * `scripts/check_docstring_names.py` — the backticked-name checker, which is where several of
#     this project's late failures have actually come from;
#   * the `sorry` grep, and anything at all about files that do not import the one being checked.
#
# A claim of the form "this compiles", in an issue, a review comment or a handover message, means
# `bash .orchestra/validation.sh`. This is for the edit loop.
#
# One further caveat, measured: the linter options carry TOML's `weak.` prefix, which means an
# option Lean does not know about is **ignored rather than rejected**. The style linters are
# registered by `Mathlib.Tactic.Linter`, so a file whose imports do not reach it gets no style
# linting from this script and no warning that it did not. Every file under `Oka/` and `OkaTest/`
# imports far more than that, so this matters only for scratch files.

# warnings as warnings inside Lean and fails at the lake level on the build log, so `#guard_msgs`
