"""Compute what upstreaming a mirror file would add to its Mathlib target's transitive imports.

`README.md`'s mirror-tree section does **not** ask a module docstring to state that number.  It
says the mirror path *"has to survive the imports they need"*, quotes one 96-file precedent, and
works one example through; stating the figure is a practice grown from those, and **26 of the 123
files under `Oka/` follow it** — counting a module docstring that says what upstreaming would cost
its target, whether as a number or as an explicit *nothing*.  A minority, measured at `bd03bee`,
expected to drift, and not a figure anything here depends on.  Counting the *vocabulary* instead
gives 44: forty-four module docstrings say `import`, `closure` or `upstream` somewhere, and **18
of those say it only** in sentences like *"this file is a candidate for upstreaming to Mathlib"*
that state no cost at all.
A number obtained by grepping for a word and reported as a count of measurements is exactly the
species of error this script exists to stop, so it is worth not making it in this paragraph.

Before this script every such figure was produced by a breadth-first search written from scratch
in the session that needed it and thrown away afterwards, and **on 2026-08-23 that instrument was
written wrong twice, by two different agents, and both wrong figures passed the project's standard
validation.**  This is the same computation with a test attached.

Usage:

    python3 scripts/import_cost.py Oka/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/Generators.lean
    python3 scripts/import_cost.py --target Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.CoveringMap \
        Mathlib.FieldTheory.IsAlgClosed.Basic
    python3 scripts/import_cost.py --self-test

It reads text and nothing else: no build, no oleans, no `lake`.  Exit 0 unless something is wrong
with the arguments or the self-test fails; the cost itself is output, not a verdict, because the
figures live in English prose and nothing can check them mechanically.  See
`.orchestra/validation.sh` for what *is* a gate.

## The defect this exists to stop, which is not hypothetical

The obvious instrument is `re.compile(r"^(?:public\\s+)?import\\s+([\\w.]+)", re.M)` over the raw
file text.  **That matches `import` lines inside comments.**  Under `Mathlib/` there are

* **14 files** carrying such a line, **29 lines** in all — 18 of the lines inside a `/-!` module
  docstring and 7 inside a `/--` declaration docstring, so **12 of the 14 files**; the other 4
  lines, in the two files under `RingTheory/AdicCompletion/`, sit inside a plain `/-` block
  holding commented-out `variable`s and `example`s, with the `import` at the top where a real one
  would go.  **Those two are the better example of the defect**, because nobody would call them
  documentation and the regex matches them anyway;
* **2 of them a bare `import Mathlib`** — `Mathlib/Tactic/Rify.lean` and
  `Mathlib/Analysis/Normed/Algebra/Exponential.lean`, both inside fenced example blocks — at which
  point the computed closure becomes the entire library;
* and one that reaches almost every closure: **`Mathlib/Tactic/FunProp.lean`**, whose documentation
  shows `import Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.Trigonometric` as an example.  Following it pulls that
  module's whole closure — 1238 Mathlib modules — into almost every closure.

**What that edge costs is a fact about the baseline and not about the edge**, so it is quoted here
against named targets rather than as a number on its own.  Against
`Mathlib.Algebra.Category.ModuleCat.Sheaf.PushforwardContinuous` it takes the closure from **1473
to 1744**, so the edge adds **271** — of which only **8** are under `Mathlib/Analysis/`, the rest
being the algebra, topology and order substrate that one analysis module sits on.  Against
`Mathlib.FieldTheory.IsAlgClosed.Basic` it adds **223**; against a closure that already reaches
complex analysis it adds nothing.  **271 is that edge's share and 274 is the whole inflation of
that closure**: the other three are `Mathlib.Algebra.Polynomial.Basic`,
`Mathlib.Data.Sym.Sym2.Init` and `Mathlib.Algebra.Group.AddChar`, reached from phantom edges in
`Mathlib/Tactic/ExtractGoal.lean` and `Mathlib/Tactic/MinImports.lean`.  An earlier draft of this
paragraph read *"that single phantom edge pulls in 274 analysis modules"*, which attaches a total
to a part, calls substrate modules analysis, and gives a baseline-relative figure with no
baseline.  Getting that sentence wrong inside the file whose subject is exactly this is the reason
it is spelled out at length.

The full list, for a reader who wants to check rather than believe: `AlgebraicGeometry/Scheme`,
`Tactic/Rify`, `Tactic/MinImports`, `Tactic/FunProp`, `Tactic/Common`, `Tactic/ExtractGoal`,
`Tactic/Linter/UpstreamableDecl`, `Tactic/Linter/Header`, `LinearAlgebra/Basis/VectorSpace`,
`RingTheory/AdicCompletion/AsTensorProduct`, `RingTheory/AdicCompletion/Functoriality`,
`Algebra/Group/UniqueProds/Basic`, `Data/Int/Log`, `Analysis/Normed/Algebra/Exponential`.  It is a
fact about Mathlib at a version and it will drift; the masking is what does not.

**The direction of the error is not predictable.**  The baseline always inflates, but the marginal
cost can move either way, because the phantom modules land on *both* sides of the subtraction.  In
the real instance, the true cost 103 was reported as 75.  "The total may be off but the delta is
probably fine" is a reading this project has used and it is not safe.

## Why the usual validation does not catch it

The convention here is to check a fresh instrument against the two figures the tree already
carries — `Mathlib.RingTheory.Localization.Finiteness` costs
`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Modules/Tilde.lean` **2**, and
`Mathlib.Algebra.Category.ModuleCat.Sheaf.Generators` costs
`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Modules/Sheaf.lean` **3**.  Both are in `self_test` below as regression
cases, and **both reproduce on the broken instrument**: neither target's closure reaches a
comment-embedded import in a way that moves the delta, because they sit in categories and algebra
and the phantom edges lead into analysis.  Two agreeing deltas in one corner of the library are
not a test of a closure computation.  The case that is a test is
`self_test`'s `import Mathlib` fixture, and the tripwire in `closure` is the cheap version of it.

## What is counted

**Mathlib modules only** — modules with a file under `Mathlib/`.  A closure also contains
`Aesop.*`, `Batteries.*`, `Init.*` and `Lean.*`, roughly a hundred of them, and two reviewers have
independently hit that discrepancy and each spent a paragraph attributing it.  The output says so
on every line that carries a number.

## What is priced, and what is not

The headline cost counts only the file's **`Mathlib.` imports**.  An `Oka.` import cannot go into
that sum: a mirror file's cost is against *its own* Mathlib target, not against this one's, so the
two numbers are not comparable and adding them means nothing.

**There is a third number, and it is the one a module docstring actually needs**: what *this*
target pays if that dependency lands at its own mirror path and has to come along.  It is well
defined, it is a `cost` call against a target the script has already resolved in order to print
the `mirrors …` line, and **it is now printed, one figure per dropped import**.

`Oka/Geometry/RingedSpace/LocallyRingedSpace/HasColimits.lean` is why that matters.  It has one
`Mathlib.` import, already in the target's closure, so the headline cost is **0** — and its module
docstring said upstreaming would cost that file *nothing*, which was false: the cover it defines
is stated in terms of `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.OpenCover`, whose mirror target costs
that same target **3**.  Repairing it took taxis #1021 and two pull requests.  The author had run
this script; **the script had declined to price the import and the docstring read the silence as
a zero.**  The three modules are now named in the output, which is what that repair had to
compute by hand.

`Oka/Geometry/RingedSpace/PresheafedSpace/Gluing.lean` is the same shape at a scale nobody would
guess: headline cost **0**, while one of its three `Oka.` imports,
`Oka.AlgebraicGeometry.GammaSpecAdjunction`, costs that same target **359** on a baseline of 1697.
Both numbers are true of different questions, and the author is now given both without leaving
the tool.

**It is the number authors were already computing by hand**, which is the argument that it belongs
here rather than in a reader's head.  `Oka/RingTheory/Filtration.lean` — the placement `README.md`
works through — states the whole comparison in its own docstring: closures of **1291** and
**1228**, *"adding `ResidueField.Basic` to `Filtration` costs 33 files; adding `Filtration` to
`ResidueField.Basic` costs 96"*.  All four reproduce exactly, and the 33 is what this script now
prints for that file's one dropped import without being asked.  `self_test` pins both directions,
because 33 on its own decides nothing: the decision was the comparison.

**The dropped figures do not add — not to each other, and not to the headline cost.**  Each is
computed against the same baseline, so shared ancestors are counted twice by anyone who sums
them, and the output says so on the line that introduces them.  This is not a caution about
arithmetic in general: `Oka/AlgebraicGeometry/Modules/Sheaf.lean` is a worked counterexample in
this tree.  Its headline cost is **3** and its `Oka.Algebra.Category.ModuleCat.Sheaf.Quasicoherent`
prices at **5**; taking both is **5**, not 8, because the mirror target's closure already contains
everything the two `Mathlib.` imports add.  `self_test` pins that, and
`Oka/AlgebraicGeometry/Modules/Tilde.lean` records the same trap for the `Mathlib.` imports alone.

**And the figure is conditional, so it is an upper bound on a decision rather than a property of
a file.**  It is what the target pays if the declarations needing that import go upstream with it.
In `HasColimits.lean` the import is needed by the cover, and by what is stated in terms of the
cover, and by nothing else in the file — which is why the repair there was to split the
destination rather than to pay the 3.  Nothing textual can see which declarations need what, and
this script does not pretend to.

**Not every dropped import has a Mathlib file at its own mirror path**, and the output says which
do: measured at `538e13d`, **11 of the 43** files under `Oka/` with a Mathlib target import
another `Oka` module, **18** such import lines between them naming 16 distinct modules.  **3** of
the 18 are mirror files for a Mathlib file that does not exist
(`Oka/AlgebraicGeometry/Modules/Tilde.lean`, `Oka/RingTheory/MvPolynomial/Ideal.lean` and
`Oka/RingTheory/RingHom/FaithfullyFlat.lean` each have one).  Those cannot be priced at all, by
this script or by hand, and the output says so in different words from the ones it uses for a path
that is not a mirror path at all.

Of the 15 that can be priced, **10 cost 0 and 5 cost something**.  That ratio is why the old
behaviour survived as long as it did: ten of those fifteen silences were a correct zero, so
reading one as a zero worked until it did not.

Until this figure was printed the omission had to be argued for, and the argument turned on how
many dropped imports state their own cost somewhere in their own docstrings.  It no longer has
to; what stays is the reason the numbers cannot be **added**, which is above and is unchanged.

## Two limitations a reader should not have to discover

`strip_comments` does not know about string literals, so a `/-` inside one opens a comment as far
as it is concerned.  That cannot bite on this input — imports precede any string literal in a Lean
file, so a spurious open can only blank text *after* the import block — but it is a real
limitation and not an oversight.  And the size check in `closure` is a `raise` rather than an
`assert` deliberately: `python3 -O` strips assertions, and a tripwire that a flag can remove is
not one.
