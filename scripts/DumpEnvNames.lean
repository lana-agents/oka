# Environment name dump, for `scripts/check_docstring_names.py`

Writes every non-internal constant name and every imported module name in the environment of
`Oka` + `OkaTest`, one per line, to the file named by the environment variable
`OKA_ENV_NAME_DUMP` (default `env-names.txt` in the working directory).

This file is deliberately **not** part of either library: it is run with `lake env lean`, so it
is compiled fresh each time against the oleans the build has already produced, and it is not
reachable from `Oka.lean` or `OkaTest.lean`. Adding it to a library would make every build
elaborate a file whose only purpose is to write a temporary file.

Module names are dumped alongside constants because docstrings on this project cite modules —
`Oka.Weierstrass`, `Mathlib.RingTheory.Filtration` — in exactly the same backticked form as
declarations, and a checker that knew only about constants would report all of them.

## The format, and why the two kinds are told apart

Each line is `<kind>` TAB `<name>`, with `kind` either `module` or `decl`. **A name never
contains a tab**, so the split is unambiguous.

The tag exists because the checker's field-notation rule — which accepts `head.tail` when `head`
resolves and is not a namespace, reading it as generalised field notation on the *term* `head` —
is only ever right when `head` is a **declaration**. A module is not a term and has no fields, so
`` `OkaTest.FiniteMorphism.someDecl` `` is not field notation on anything; without the tag it was
accepted anyway, because modules and constants arrived here in one undifferentiated list and the
rule could not see which it had. That made every `OkaTest/` module a head under which any tail
whatsoever passed unchecked, since those modules declare into `ComplexAnalytic` and so are
themselves empty as namespaces. See taxis #1326 for the control that measured it.

**An untagged line is read as a declaration**, so a dump written by a checkout that predates the
tag still parses; the checker says on stderr that it cannot tell modules from declarations in
that case rather than silently reverting to the old behaviour.
