# Declaration dump with declaring modules, for `scripts/guard_coverage.py`

Writes every non-internal constant declared by a module of this repository — a module whose name
starts with `Oka` or `OkaTest` — as `module<TAB>name`, one per line, to the file named by the
environment variable `OKA_DECL_DUMP` (default `oka-decls.txt` in the working directory).

## Why this is not `scripts/DumpEnvNames.lean`

That file answers *"is this backticked token a name at all?"* and so dumps the whole environment,
Mathlib included, and says of each name only whether it is a declaration or a module. This one
answers *"which declarations does this repository own, and where does each one live?"*, which
needs the **declaring module** and needs Mathlib excluded. Both questions have a consumer and
**neither dump can be derived from the other**: `scripts/DumpEnvNames.lean`'s output attaches no
declaring module, so this one cannot be read out of it, and it contains all of Mathlib, which
this one must not.

**That is the whole of the argument, and it used to have a second half that is now false.** Until
2026-08-31 this paragraph added that giving `scripts/DumpEnvNames.lean`'s output a column *"would
change every line of a file `scripts/check_docstring_names.py` reads as one name per line"*, and
offered that cost as a reason not to merge the two. taxis #1326 then gave it one — every line is
now `<kind>` TAB `<name>` — and the price turned out to be two `partition("\t")` calls, one in
that checker and one in `scripts/guard_coverage.py`. **A cost argument against an untried change
is worth exactly what it cost when somebody tried it**, and the reason above needs no help from
this one.

The declaring module is read from `env.header.moduleData`, which is the module's own list of the
constants it adds, rather than from a name prefix. A prefix test would be wrong in both
directions here: this repository declares into `AlgebraicGeometry`, `CategoryTheory` and
`Polynomial` from its mirror tree, and Mathlib declares into none of the namespaces that start
with `Oka`.

This file is deliberately **not** part of either library, for the same reason
`scripts/DumpEnvNames.lean` is not: it is run with `lake env lean` against the oleans the build
has already produced, and is reachable from neither `Oka.lean` nor `OkaTest.lean`.
