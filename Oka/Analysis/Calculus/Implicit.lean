# A level set projects to the remaining coordinates by a local homeomorphism

Let `f : (ι → 𝕜) → 𝕜` be strictly differentiable at a point of the level set `{z | f z = c}`,
and let `j : ι` be a coordinate at which the derivative does not vanish — `f' (Pi.single j 1) ≠ 0`.
Forgetting the `j`-th coordinate then maps a neighbourhood of that point *inside the level set*
homeomorphically onto an open set. That is the topological half of the implicit function theorem:
the level set is locally a graph over the remaining coordinates, and here only the *local
homeomorphism* is extracted, not the graph.

`e : κ ↪ ι` is the enumeration of the remaining coordinates, asked for as an embedding whose
range is exactly the complement of `j` (`he` and `hj` below). Forgetting the `j`-th coordinate is
then `fun z ↦ z ∘ e`.

## What this is built from

`Mathlib.Analysis.Calculus.Implicit` already has the whole analytic content, in the form of
`ImplicitFunctionData`: a pair of maps whose derivatives are surjective with complementary
kernels is packaged by `ImplicitFunctionData.toOpenPartialHomeomorph` into a partial
homeomorphism `z ↦ (leftFun z, rightFun z)`. Everything below is a matter of supplying that datum
in coordinates and of reading off what it says about one fibre of the first component:

* `ImplicitFunctionData.ofCoordProj` is the datum with `leftFun = f` and
  `rightFun = fun z ↦ z ∘ e`. Its three conditions are all elementary — `f'` is onto `𝕜` because
  `f' (Pi.single j 1) ≠ 0`, restriction of coordinates is onto because `e` is injective
  (`Function.Injective.extend_apply`), and the two kernels are complementary because
  `ker (fun z ↦ z ∘ e)` is the line spanned by `Pi.single j 1`, on which `f'` is nonzero.
* `ImplicitFunctionData.injOn_rightFun_levelSet` and
  `ImplicitFunctionData.isOpen_image_rightFun_levelSet` are the two halves of "an open embedding",
  for a general datum: on the level set through `pt`, the pair `(leftFun, rightFun)` has a
  constant first component, so `rightFun` inherits injectivity from the partial homeomorphism, and
  the image of an open set is the slice of an open set at that constant.

**No completeness or invertibility is proved here and none is assumed beyond Mathlib's own.**
`ImplicitFunctionData` asks for `CompleteSpace` on all three spaces; `ι` and `κ` are finite and
`𝕜` is complete, which is where `[CompleteSpace 𝕜]` and the two `Finite` instances go.

## Main definitions

- `ImplicitFunctionData.ofCoordProj`

## Main results

- `ImplicitFunctionData.injOn_rightFun_levelSet`
- `ImplicitFunctionData.isOpen_image_rightFun_levelSet`
- `isLocalHomeomorph_coordProj_comp_of_isEmbedding_inter`: **the same on the part of the level set
  lying in an open set**, with the two analytic hypotheses asked only there. This is the form a
  restriction of the embedded space needs, and the unrestricted statement is it at `Set.univ`.
- `isLocalHomeomorph_coordProj_comp_of_isEmbedding`: **forgetting the `j`-th coordinate is a local
  homeomorphism on the level set**, stated for an arbitrary topological space embedded onto that
  level set, which is the form a subspace of `ι → 𝕜` carrying extra structure needs.
- `isLocalHomeomorph_coordProj_levelSet`: the same for the level set itself, as a subtype.

## What is not here

* **No implicit function.** `ImplicitFunctionData.implicitFunction` is the map whose graph the
  level set locally is, and nothing below names it: the statements are about the *projection*
  being a local homeomorphism and say nothing about a section of it, let alone a differentiable
  one. A caller that needs the graph should use Mathlib's `implicitFunction` directly.
* **No smoothness of the local inverse**, for the same reason.
* **Nothing about the level set as a manifold or as an analytic space.** The conclusion is a
  statement about topological spaces.
* **No converse.** Nothing says that a level set on which the projection is a local homeomorphism
  has a nonvanishing derivative, and the hypothesis is not necessary: `f` could be constant in a
  different set of coordinates.
* **Nothing for a piece of the level set that is not relatively open.** The `Ω` of
  `isLocalHomeomorph_coordProj_comp_of_isEmbedding_inter` is an *open* subset of `ι → 𝕜`, and its
  openness is used and not decorative: the last step exhibits the image of an open set as the
  slice of `W₀ ∩ Ω ∩ φ.toOpenPartialHomeomorph.source`, which has to be open. **Whether some
  weaker condition on `Ω` would do is not asked and no counterexample is compiled**; what is
  recorded here is only that the hypothesis is load-bearing at that step.
* **`e` is asked to enumerate the complement of `j` exactly.** With `Set.range e` smaller the
  projection forgets more than one coordinate and the conclusion is false; with `j ∈ Set.range e`
  the two kernels are not complementary. Both are hypotheses `he` and `hj` and neither is derived.

/-- **Forgetting the `j`-th coordinate is a local homeomorphism on a relatively open piece of a
level set of `f`**, at every point of which the derivative of `f` in the `j`-th direction is
nonzero.

`isLocalHomeomorph_coordProj_comp_of_isEmbedding` is this at `Ω = Set.univ`, and the two differ in
exactly the way a *restriction of the source* needs: `g` is asked to embed `T` onto the part of the
level set lying in an open `Ω`, not onto all of it, and the two analytic hypotheses are asked only
there. An embedding onto the whole level set followed by the inclusion of an open subspace of `T`
is an embedding onto such a piece and onto no smaller a set, which is why intersecting with an open
is the right weakening and cutting out an arbitrary subset is not: the proof below needs the
neighbourhood it builds inside `Ω` to stay inside the image of `T`.

Everything in the proof is the argument of the unrestricted statement with `Ω` carried along; the
only step that is not bookkeeping is `hset`, where the open set whose slice the image is has to be
shrunk to `W₀ ∩ Ω` so that the slice is `g '' (U ∩ W')` and not a larger piece of the level set. -/

/-- **Forgetting the `j`-th coordinate is a local homeomorphism on a level set of `f`**, at every
point of which the derivative of `f` in the `j`-th direction is nonzero.

The level set is not taken as a subtype but presented by a topological embedding `g` of an
arbitrary space onto it, which is what a subspace carrying its own structure — a complex analytic
space cut out by `f`, say — supplies.

The proof is the implicit function theorem at each point and nothing else: `g x` lies in the
source of the partial homeomorphism `z ↦ (f z, z ∘ e)` of
`ImplicitFunctionData.ofCoordProj`, its `g`-preimage is the required neighbourhood, and the two
halves of `IsOpenEmbedding` on it are
`ImplicitFunctionData.injOn_rightFun_levelSet` and
`ImplicitFunctionData.isOpen_image_rightFun_levelSet`. Openness of the image needs that an open
subset of the domain is `g ⁻¹' W` for some open `W`, which is `Topology.IsInducing.isOpen_iff`. -/
