# `x ↦ xⁿ` on the nonzero elements of a proper normed field is closed with finite fibres

Material for `Mathlib/Analysis/Complex/CoveringMap.lean`; see `README.md` on the mirror tree.
That file's import closure already contains everything these need — including
`Mathlib.Algebra.Polynomial.Roots` — so upstreaming them costs it **no** new imports.
That file proves `isCoveringMap_npow`: for `n ≠ 0` in `𝕜`, the map
`x ↦ xⁿ` from `{x : 𝕜 // x ≠ 0}` to itself is a covering map. These are the two remaining
properties of that map that a *finiteness* statement needs and that being a covering map does not
give: it is a **closed** map, and its fibres are **finite** rather than merely discrete.

Both are stated at the generality of `isCoveringMap_npow`'s second half — a
`NontriviallyNormedField` — because `Mathlib/Analysis/Complex/CoveringMap.lean` already has a
section at exactly that generality. Neither uses `isCoveringMap_npow`. **`ProperSpace` is needed
only for the closedness**, which is where `isClosedMap_pow` enters; the fibre statement omits it,
and the `omit` on it is not tidiness but a claim: the fibres are finite for a reason that has
nothing to do with the topology.

* **Closedness** is `isClosedMap_pow` on the whole field, restricted along
  `(· ^ n) ⁻¹' {0}ᶜ = {0}ᶜ`. The restriction step is the standard one — if `f` is closed and
  `T = f ⁻¹' S`, then `f` restricted to `T → S` is closed, because for `C = D ∩ T` with `D`
  closed one has `f '' C = f '' D ∩ S` — and it is done by hand here rather than through
  `IsClosedMap.restrictPreimage`, whose domain is `↥((· ^ n) ⁻¹' {0}ᶜ)` and needs transporting
  along `Homeomorph.setCongr` to `{x // x ≠ 0}`. **That transport is not free**: the
  `Homeomorph.setCongr` route left a goal `↑z * ↑z = ↑(e z) * ↑(e z)` that `rw` refused with a
  transparency complaint about the subtype instance. The direct proof is twelve lines and has no
  such seam.
* **Finiteness of the fibres** is `Polynomial.finite_setOf_isRoot` at `X ^ n - C w`, which is
  nonzero exactly because `n ≠ 0`.

/-- **`x ↦ xⁿ` is a closed map from the nonzero elements of a proper normed field to
themselves.**

`isClosedMap_pow` gives it on the whole field; what is added here is that the restriction to the
nonzero elements is again closed, which holds because the nonzero elements are exactly the
preimage of themselves. -/

/-- **The fibres of `x ↦ xⁿ` on the nonzero elements of a proper normed field are finite.**

Being a covering map (`isCoveringMap_npow`) makes the fibres *discrete*, which over a
non-compact base is not finiteness. This is the polynomial statement instead: the fibre injects
into the roots of `X ^ n - C w`, and that polynomial is nonzero exactly because `n ≠ 0`. -/
