# Flatness is stable under quotienting by an ideal of the base

Material for `Mathlib/RingTheory/Flat/Stability.lean`, next to `Module.Flat.baseChange`; see
`README.md` on the mirror tree. `Oka/RingTheory/Flat/Descent.lean` is bound for the same Mathlib
file and says the complementary thing — cancellation on the right of a tower.

If `B` is flat over `A` and `I` is an ideal of `A`, then `B ⧸ I B` is flat over `A ⧸ I`, and the
same with "faithfully" throughout. This is base change along `A → A ⧸ I`, which Mathlib already
has; the only thing missing is that the base change of `B` *is* `B ⧸ I B`, which is
`Algebra.TensorProduct.quotIdealMapEquivQuotTensor`. So both proofs are one transport each.

## Why it is worth stating separately

Base change is usually applied with the *new base* in hand and the tensor product as the answer.
Here it is the other way round: the ring one has is `B ⧸ I B` — a quotient of germs by an ideal
sheaf, a coordinate ring, a stalk of a closed subscheme — and the tensor product is a step of the
proof one would rather not see in the statement.

## Main results

- `Module.Flat.quotIdealMap`: flatness of `A ⧸ I → B ⧸ I B`.
- `Module.FaithfullyFlat.quotIdealMap`: the same for faithful flatness.

The unqualified statement, unlike the one for a general tower: faithful flatness is preserved by
*arbitrary* base change, so nothing has to be assumed about `I`. -/
