# Adjoining an inverse to a quotient of a polynomial ring, in one more variable

Material for `Mathlib/RingTheory/MvPolynomial/Localization.lean`; see `README.md` on the mirror
tree.

For an ideal `I` of `R[xᵢ]` and `f : R[xᵢ]`, the classical presentation of the localisation of
`R[xᵢ] ⧸ I` away from the image of `f` adjoins **one** variable and **one** equation:

  `(R[xᵢ] ⧸ I)_f = R[xᵢ, t] ⧸ (I, t·f - 1)`.

`MvPolynomial.awayIdeal I f` is the ideal on the right, in `R[Option σ]` with `none` the new
variable, and `MvPolynomial.isLocalization_away_quotient_awayIdeal` says the quotient by it
**is** that localisation — not merely isomorphic to it, but an `IsLocalization.Away` for the
image of `f`, so that the universal property is available at the presented algebra directly and
a consumer does not have to transport along an isomorphism to use it.

## What Mathlib already has, and what this adds

`IsLocalization.Away.mvPolynomialQuotientEquiv` is the same statement in **one** variable over an
arbitrary base: `A[t] ⧸ (r·t - 1) ≃ₐ[A] S` for `[IsLocalization.Away r S]`. It is not directly
usable for a quotient of a polynomial ring, because the base one wants there is `R[xᵢ] ⧸ I` while
the ring one has in hand is `R[xᵢ, t] ⧸ (I, t·f - 1)`: the two differ by the transport that
commutes a quotient past a polynomial ring, and it is that transport, not the localisation, that
is the work. This file goes round it instead of through it, by exhibiting the two maps and
checking both composites on generators, which is shorter and leaves no `Option σ ≃ Unit ⊕ σ`
bookkeeping in the statement.

## Main definitions

- `MvPolynomial.awayIdeal`: the ideal `(I, t·f - 1)` of `R[Option σ]`.
- `MvPolynomial.awayBaseHom`: the map `R[xᵢ] ⧸ I ⟶ R[xᵢ, t] ⧸ (I, t·f - 1)`, which is the
  `Algebra` structure the localisation statement is about.
- `MvPolynomial.awayQuotientEquiv`: the resulting isomorphism with `Localization.Away`.

## Main results

- `MvPolynomial.isLocalization_away_quotient_awayIdeal`: **the quotient is the localisation.**
  This is the statement to use; the isomorphism is a corollary of it and of nothing else.

## What is not here

**No claim that `MvPolynomial.awayIdeal` is a *presentation* in Mathlib's structured sense.**
`Mathlib/RingTheory/Extension/Presentation/Basic.lean` has a `localizationAway` presentation at
`:225` and composes it with a presentation of the base, and its `relation_comp_localizationAway_inl`
at `:460` computes the composed relation to be `rename Sum.inr (P.σ g) * X (Sum.inl ()) - 1` —
the same equation as here, up to a reindexing of `Option σ` as `Unit ⊕ σ`. Nothing here is stated
in those terms, and a consumer wanting the structured presentation should build it from that
route. Note before taking it that the Mathlib lemma carries two hypotheses on the chosen
set-theoretic section, `P.σ (-1) = -1` and `P.σ 0 = 0`, which have no analogue here; that file is
not imported, which is why its declarations are named above by path and line rather than in
backticks.
