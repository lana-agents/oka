# Coefficient fields of local rings

Material for `Mathlib/RingTheory/LocalRing/ResidueField/Basic.lean`; see `README.md` on the
mirror tree.

A ring homomorphism `α : K →+* S` from a field into a local ring makes `K` a **coefficient
field** of `S` when every element of `S` is congruent to a constant `α c` modulo the maximal
ideal — equivalently, when `K → S → S ⧸ 𝔪` is an isomorphism, the constant being then unique.
This is the classical notion from Cohen structure theory, and it is what says "the residue field
of `S` is `K`" in the form the applications want: not merely that `ResidueField S` happens to be
isomorphic to `K`, but that a *chosen* `K`-algebra structure realises it, so that the resulting
`S →+* K` deserves to be called evaluation.

Nothing here is specific to any one `K`: the intended application is `K = ℂ` and `S` a stalk of
the structure sheaf of a complex analytic space, where `α` is the germ of a constant function
and `IsCoefficientField.evalHom` is the value of a germ at the point.

## Main definitions

- `IsLocalRing.IsCoefficientField`: `α : K →+* S` realises the field `K` as a coefficient field
  of the local ring `S`.
- `IsLocalRing.IsCoefficientField.residueFieldEquiv`: the induced isomorphism
  `ResidueField S ≃+* K`.
- `IsLocalRing.IsCoefficientField.evalHom`: the induced ring homomorphism `S →+* K`, a retraction
  of `α` with kernel the maximal ideal.

## Main results

- `IsLocalRing.IsCoefficientField.existsUnique_sub_mem_maximalIdeal`: the constant is unique.
- `IsLocalRing.IsCoefficientField.of_surjective`: a coefficient field is inherited by any
  quotient, more precisely by the target of any surjective ring homomorphism compatible with the
  constants. This is the transport principle that makes the notion usable: local rings are
  usually reached from a ring one understands by a surjection.
- `IsLocalRing.IsCoefficientField.evalHom_map`: such a surjection commutes with evaluation.

/-- A ring homomorphism `α : K →+* S` from a field into a local ring realises `K` as a
**coefficient field** of `S` if every element of `S` differs from a constant `α c` by an element
of the maximal ideal.

The constant is then automatically unique
(`IsLocalRing.IsCoefficientField.existsUnique_sub_mem_maximalIdeal`), because a nonzero constant
is a unit; equivalently, the composite `K → S → ResidueField S` is a ring isomorphism
(`IsLocalRing.IsCoefficientField.residueFieldEquiv`). -/
