# Relations between elements of a ring localise

Material for `Mathlib/RingTheory/Localization/Module.lean`; see `README.md` on the mirror tree.
Nothing here is complex-analytic.

Let `S` be a localisation of `R` at a submonoid `M`, let `f : ι → R` be a finite family, and let
`g : κ → (ι → R)` be a finite family of relations between the `f i` which generates *all* of
them, in the sense that every `b` with `∑ i, b i * f i = 0` lies in the `R`-span of the `g l`.
Then the images of the `g l` generate the relations between the images of the `f i` over `S`.

The proof is clearing denominators twice and is the reason no flatness is needed: given a
relation `a` over `S`, one `M`-multiple of it comes from `R`
(`IsLocalization.exist_integer_multiples`), a second `M`-multiple makes the resulting family an
honest relation over `R` (`IsLocalization.map_eq_zero_iff`), and both multipliers become units
in `S`.

## Import cost

Both imports above — `Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.Finsupp.LinearCombination` and
`Mathlib.RingTheory.Localization.Integer` — are already in the transitive closure of
`Mathlib/RingTheory/Localization/Module.lean`, so upstreaming this file adds **0 files** to it.
That target's closure is **963** modules with a file under `Mathlib/`, before and after.

Take the figure with `python3 scripts/import_cost.py Oka/RingTheory/Localization/Module.lean`
rather than with a breadth-first search written for the occasion; the two costs this paragraph
used to cite as its own validation are regression cases in that script's `--self-test` and both
are still exact — `Mathlib.RingTheory.Localization.Finiteness` costs
`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Modules/Tilde.lean` 2, and
`Mathlib.Algebra.Category.ModuleCat.Sheaf.Generators` costs
`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Modules/Sheaf.lean` 3.

**The baseline here used to read 1460**, which reproduces under no counting: 963 masked and
Mathlib-only, 1053 counting every module name the search reaches, and 1360 if it follows the
`import` lines inside Mathlib's own docstrings. The **0** was right throughout, and a wrong
baseline standing beside a right cost is why every line of the script's output that carries a
number says `(Mathlib files only)`.

## Main results

- `IsLocalization.exists_fun_eq_sum_of_sum_mul_eq_zero`: a relation over the localisation is a
  combination of the images of generating relations over the base.

/-- **Generating relations stay generating in a localisation.**

If every `R`-relation between the `f i` is an `R`-combination of the `g l`, then every
`S`-relation between the images of the `f i` is an `S`-combination of the images of the `g l`,
for `S` a localisation of `R`.

Note that neither `f` nor `g` is assumed to have any property beyond finiteness of the index
types: the hypothesis `hgen` is the only thing that ties them together, and it is exactly what
noetherianity of `R` supplies for a suitable finite `g`. -/
