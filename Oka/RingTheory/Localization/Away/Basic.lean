# Localising away from two elements with the same non-vanishing locus

Material for `Mathlib/RingTheory/Localization/Away/Basic.lean`; see `README.md` on the mirror
tree. Upstreaming costs that file **nothing**: it is the file's own import, and the two extra
declarations named below are already in it.

`IsLocalization.Away r S` depends on `r` only through the saturation of `Submonoid.powers r` —
geometrically, only through the basic open `D(r) ⊆ Spec R`. Mathlib records the special case
where `r` and `r'` are *associated* (`IsLocalization.Away.of_associated` and
`IsLocalization.Away.iff_of_associated`), which is strictly stronger than having the same basic
open: `r` and `r ^ 2` have the same basic open and are associated only when `r` is a unit.

The general condition is symmetric divisibility of powers, and it is the condition Mathlib's own
`IsLocalization.Away.algebraMap_isUnit_iff` is already phrased in: `IsUnit (algebraMap R S r')`
holds exactly when `r'` divides a power of `r`. So the hypotheses below are, term by term, *"`r'`
becomes a unit"* and *"`r` becomes a unit"*, and no radical, prime spectrum or `Ideal` appears in
the statement or the proof.

## Main results

- `IsLocalization.Away.of_dvd_pow`: **a localisation away from `r` is a localisation away from
  `r'`**, when each of the two divides a power of the other.
- `IsLocalization.Away.iff_of_dvd_pow`: the same as an `Iff`, in the shape of
  `IsLocalization.Away.iff_of_associated`.
- `IsLocalization.Away.algEquivOfDvdPow`: the resulting isomorphism of the two localisations,
  over `R`.

## Implementation notes

`IsLocalization.Away.of_dvd_pow` is proved through `IsLocalization.Away.mk` rather than by
comparing submonoids. The three fields it asks for are the three places the hypotheses are used,
and each is one rewrite: writing `r' ^ m = r * c`, a fraction with denominator `r ^ n` is one
with denominator `r' ^ (m * n)` and numerator multiplied by `c ^ n`, and an equation killed by
`r ^ n` is killed by `r' ^ (m * n)`. Neither hypothesis is needed in the other's places, which is
why `IsLocalization.Away.iff_of_dvd_pow` can hand them back swapped.

/-- **An `R`-algebra which is a localisation away from `r` is a localisation away from any `r'`
with the same non-vanishing locus**, the locus being recorded by the two divisibilities: `r'`
divides a power of `r` and `r` divides a power of `r'`.

Strictly weaker hypotheses than `IsLocalization.Away.of_associated`, which asks that `r` and `r'`
differ by a unit. -/

/-- **Two localisations away from elements with the same non-vanishing locus are isomorphic**, as
`R`-algebras.

The isomorphism is `IsLocalization.algEquiv` at `Submonoid.powers r'`, which is available once
`IsLocalization.Away.of_dvd_pow` has made `S` a localisation at that submonoid too. So it is the
*unique* `R`-algebra map between them, and in particular is compatible with everything either
localisation is used for. -/
