# Localising at a maximal ideal does not change the quotients by its powers

Material for `Mathlib/RingTheory/Localization/AtPrime/Basic.lean`; see `README.md` on the mirror
tree. Upstreaming it adds nothing: that file's transitive closure is **1227** Mathlib modules,
the import above is the target itself, and the cost is **0**, measured with
`python3 scripts/import_cost.py Oka/RingTheory/Localization/AtPrime/Basic.lean`.

**This file was `Oka/RingTheory/Localization/Ideal.lean` until taxis #935**, proposing
`Mathlib/RingTheory/Localization/Ideal.lean` at **113** on a closure of 1114 — the price of
`Mathlib.RingTheory.Localization.AtPrime.Basic`, which accounted for all 113 on its own, with
`Mathlib.RingTheory.Ideal.Quotient.Nilpotent`'s 91 contained in it as a set. Everything below is
*about* `Localization.AtPrime p`, which is defined in `AtPrime/Basic.lean` and is not in
`Localization/Ideal.lean`'s closure, so the old path had to buy the new one in order to state
anything at all — while the new path already imports both of the old file's imports.
**A mirror path that cannot state its own declarations is the sharpest case of `README.md`'s
test that the path has to survive the imports its results need.**

For a **maximal** ideal `p` of `R`, the canonical map

```
R ⧸ p ^ k  ⟶  R_p ⧸ (p R_p) ^ k
```

is an isomorphism: everything outside `p` is already invertible modulo `p ^ k`, so there is
nothing left for the localisation to invert. This is the statement that makes the `p`-adic
completion of `R` and the completion of the local ring `R_p` the same thing, and it is the reason
one may compute with either.

Both halves are already in Mathlib and neither is stated in terms of the other:
`Ideal.Quotient.isUnit_mk_pow_of_notMem` says an element outside a maximal ideal is a unit modulo
its `k`-th power, and the instance in `Mathlib/RingTheory/Localization/Ideal.lean` says a quotient
of a localisation is a localisation of the quotient. `IsLocalization.atUnits` — a localisation at
a submonoid of units is the ring itself — turns the first into the hypothesis the second needs.

## Main definitions

- `IsLocalization.quotientPowAtPrimeEquiv`: **`R ⧸ p ^ k ≃ R_p ⧸ (p R_p) ^ k`** for `p` maximal,
  as an algebra isomorphism over any base ring `A` under `R`.
