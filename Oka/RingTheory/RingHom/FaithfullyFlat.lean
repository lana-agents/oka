# Quotienting a faithfully flat ring map by an ideal of the source

Material for `Mathlib/RingTheory/RingHom/FaithfullyFlat.lean`; see `README.md` on the mirror tree.

`Oka/RingTheory/Flat/Quotient.lean` says that if `B` is faithfully flat over `A` and `I` is an
ideal of `A` then `B ⧸ I B` is faithfully flat over `A ⧸ I`. That is a statement about
`Module.FaithfullyFlat` and about the `Algebra` instance; a consumer holding a bare ring
homomorphism `f : A →+* B` with `f.FaithfullyFlat` has to install `f.toAlgebra` before it
applies. This file does that once, so that the induced map on quotients can be fed to
`RingHom.FaithfullyFlat.stableUnderComposition` directly.

## Why this is not in `Oka/RingTheory/Flat/Quotient.lean`

Because the two would go to different Mathlib files. That file's destination is
`Mathlib/RingTheory/Flat/Stability.lean`, which does not know about `RingHom.FaithfullyFlat` —
adding `Mathlib.RingTheory.RingHom.FaithfullyFlat` to it would make its stated destination false,
which is the failure this project has already recorded once. A `RingHom.FaithfullyFlat` lemma
belongs where `RingHom.FaithfullyFlat` is defined.

## What is not here

* **The `RingHom.Flat` analogue.** It would go to `Mathlib/RingTheory/RingHom/Flat.lean`, a
  different file again, and nothing needs it: a consumer wanting flatness of the induced map gets
  it from `RingHom.FaithfullyFlat.flat`, and the hypothesis it would need — `Module.Flat` rather
  than `Module.FaithfullyFlat` — is not weaker in any use this development has.

## Main results

- `RingHom.FaithfullyFlat.quotIdealMap`: `A ⧸ I → B ⧸ I B` is faithfully flat.

/-- **Quotienting a faithfully flat ring map by an ideal of the source keeps it faithfully
flat**: if `f : A →+* B` is faithfully flat and `I` is an ideal of `A`, then the induced map
`A ⧸ I → B ⧸ I B` is faithfully flat.

This is `Module.FaithfullyFlat.quotIdealMap` with `f.toAlgebra` installed. Nothing is assumed
about `I`, because faithful flatness is preserved by arbitrary base change. -/
