# Over a sheet, the inverse image is the base

Let `p : E ⟶ Y` be a continuous map into the space underlying a locally ringed space, and let
`V` be an open of `E` on which `p` is an open embedding — a **sheet**. Then the inverse image
`p⁻¹Y` restricted to `V` is isomorphic, as a locally ringed space, to `Y` restricted to the open
`p '' V`:

    (p⁻¹Y)|V  ≅  Y|(p '' V)

This is what turns `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.inverseImage` — which for an arbitrary
continuous map is a sheafification with no computable sections — into something with **charts**,
and it is where a local-homeomorphism hypothesis first does any work.

There is no analytic content here, so this file is a candidate for upstreaming; it lives in the
`Oka/Geometry/` mirror of the Mathlib directory tree for that reason, as a proposed new file
beside `Oka/Geometry/RingedSpace/LocallyRingedSpace/InverseImage.lean`.

## The stalks do all the work, and the sheafification is never opened

The obvious route is to compute: over a sheet the presheaf inverse image is
`W ↦ 𝒪_Y(p '' W)` (`IsOpenMap.pullbackObjIso`), that presheaf is already a sheaf on the opens
below `V` because `p` is injective there, and so the sheafification does nothing. **That
computation is not needed and is not done here.** The inverse-image file already proves that
every stalk map of `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.inverseImageHom` is an isomorphism, and
Mathlib turns a stalkwise statement into a global one twice over:

* `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion.of_stalk_iso` — a morphism whose base is
  an open embedding and whose stalk maps are isomorphisms is an open immersion;
* `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion.to_iso` — an open immersion with
  epimorphic base is an isomorphism.

So the whole file is: compose to `Y`, observe the two hypotheses, and factor through the open.
Nothing below mentions `TopCat.Sheaf.pullback`, `CategoryTheory.toSheafify` or a section over an
open set.

## Why this file and not the inverse-image file

`Mathlib.Geometry.RingedSpace.OpenImmersion` is not among the inverse-image file's imports, and it
is what everything here rests on. Against `Mathlib/Geometry/RingedSpace/LocallyRingedSpace.lean`,
whose closure is **1688** Mathlib modules, the imports of this file cost **7** — but **6** of
those are the inverse-image file's own (the `Mathlib.Topology.Sheaves.Sheafify` chain), so the
cost of this file over its intended neighbour is exactly **1**,
`Mathlib.Geometry.RingedSpace.OpenImmersion`. Both measured with
`python3 scripts/import_cost.py --target …`.

**`Oka/Topology/IsLocalHomeomorph.lean` is deliberately not imported.** The statement that the
sheets cover belongs with the map and not with the ringed space, and pulling
`Mathlib.Topology.IsLocalHomeomorph` in here would raise this file's cost against the same
destination from **7** to **16** — the `OpenPartialHomeomorph` chain, nine modules, none of which
anything below uses. Split by destination, not by subject.

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.sheetToBase`: the sheet, mapped to `Y`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.sheetImage`: the open of `Y` the sheet lies over.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.sheetHom`: the comparison `(p⁻¹Y)|V ⟶ Y|(p '' V)`.

## Main results

- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.coe_sheetImage`: **the open is `p '' V`**, which is what
  makes the statement the one it is meant to be rather than one about an abstract range.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isIso_sheetHom`: **the comparison is an isomorphism.**
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.sheetIso`: the same, packaged as an isomorphism of
  locally ringed spaces.

## What is not here

* **No local homeomorphism.** The hypothesis is one open embedding, on one open. That the sheets
  of a local homeomorphism cover is `IsLocalHomeomorph.sSup_sheetOpens` in
  `Oka/Topology/IsLocalHomeomorph.lean`, which this file does not import; assembling the two into
  a statement about the whole of `E` is the next step and is not taken here.
* **Nothing about sections.** No formula for `𝒪_{p⁻¹Y}(W)` is proved even over a sheet; what is
  proved is that the *space* over a sheet is the base over its image, which is strictly weaker
  than a formula and is all a chart needs.
* **No cocycle and no gluing.** Two sheets `V₀`, `V₁` meeting give two isomorphisms over
  `p '' (V₀ ∩ V₁)` and nothing here compares them. The identity that makes them fit is
  `Set.InjOn.image_inter`, `p '' (V ∩ A) ∩ p '' (V ∩ B) = p '' (V ∩ A ∩ B)`; the naive
  `p '' (V₀ ∩ V₁) = p '' V₀ ∩ p '' V₁` is **false** for a covering map — the connected double
  cover of the circle, covered by two arcs each longer than a half, has `p '' V₀ = p '' V₁` the
  whole circle while `p '' (V₀ ∩ V₁)` is two proper arcs — and nothing below uses it.
* **No ℂ-algebra structure and no analytic space.** The comparison being `ComplexAnalytic`-linear
  when `Y` carries such a structure is a statement about a different category, with a different
  upstream destination, and belongs in a file under `Oka/AnalyticSpace/`.
