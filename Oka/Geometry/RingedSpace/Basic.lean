# A section is a unit on any open subset of its basic open

Material for `Mathlib/Geometry/RingedSpace/Basic.lean`; see `README.md` on the mirror tree.

Mathlib's `AlgebraicGeometry.RingedSpace.isUnit_res_basicOpen` says that a section `f` over `U`
becomes a unit when restricted to `X.basicOpen f`, and that is the only form of the statement
there. What a consumer usually holds instead is an open `V` which is merely *contained* in
`X.basicOpen f` — the open comes from somewhere else and the non-vanishing of `f` on it is a
hypothesis — and restricting a unit again keeps it a unit, so the general form is one rewrite
away from Mathlib's.

The rewrite is the only content: `Opens X` is a preorder category, so the composite of the two
restriction maps and the direct one are the same morphism by `Subsingleton.elim`.

`AlgebraicGeometry.RingedSpace.isUnit_res_basicOpen` is the case `V = X.basicOpen f`; this is
that restricted once more, along `V ≤ X.basicOpen f`. -/
