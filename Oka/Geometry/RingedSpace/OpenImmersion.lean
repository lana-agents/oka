# Two open immersions with the same image have isomorphic sources

Material for `Mathlib/Geometry/RingedSpace/OpenImmersion.lean`; see `README.md` on the mirror
tree.

Mathlib has this construction twice — as
`AlgebraicGeometry.PresheafedSpace.IsOpenImmersion.isoOfRangeEq` and as
`AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion.isoOfRangeEq` for schemes — but **not** for locally ringed
spaces, even though the two ingredients it is built from,
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion.lift` and its uniqueness, are there. The
definition below is the scheme one transcribed.

It is what identifies two presentations of the same open subspace: `X|S|T` and `X|S'|T'` are
isomorphic as soon as they have the same image in `X`, which is how a chart of an open subspace
of a complex analytic space is compared with a chart of the ambient space
(`Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenSubspace.lean`).

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion.isoOfRangeEq`: two open immersions with
  the same image have isomorphic sources.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.liftRestrict`: **a morphism whose image lies in an open
  subset factors through that open subspace** — the universal property of `X|V` as a target,
  which Mathlib has only in the form `IsOpenImmersion.lift` against an arbitrary open immersion.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.restrictLE`: the inclusion of a smaller open subspace
  into a larger one, which is `liftRestrict` of `ofRestrict`. Mathlib has `ofRestrict` for the
  inclusion into `X` itself and nothing for one open subspace inside another, although
  `IsOpenImmersion.lift` — which is what this is — is there. Both live in this file rather than
  beside `ofRestrict` because `lift` does.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isOpenImmersion_ofRestrict`: **the inclusion of an open
  subspace is an open immersion, with the open as an ordinary argument.** Mathlib has the
  instance; what this adds is a spelling at which it can be *used* from an analytic space, as
  `liftRestrict` does for a different seam. Its docstring records the measurement.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.restrictInfIsoPullback`: **the subspace on an
  intersection is the pullback of the two open subspaces**, `X|(U ⊓ V) ≅ X|U ×_X X|V`, over `X`.
  It is `isoOfRangeEq` at `range_pullback_to_base_of_left`, and it is what turns a hypothesis
  about an opaque categorical pullback into one about an open subspace.

## Main results

- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion.isoOfRangeEq_hom_fac`: the isomorphism
  commutes with the two immersions. This, rather than the isomorphism itself, is what every use
  of it consumes.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion.range_pullback_to_base_of_left`: **the
  image of the pullback of two open immersions is the intersection of their images.** Mathlib
  has this for schemes (`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/OpenImmersion.lean`) and for nothing else;
  the proofs below are those transcribed, with `LocallyRingedSpace.forgetToTop` in place of
  `Scheme.forgetToTop`. Together with `isoOfRangeEq` it is what identifies the pullback of two
  open subspace inclusions with the subspace on their intersection.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.liftRestrict_fac` and
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.hom_ext_restrict`: the factorisation through an open
  subspace is one, and is unique. A morphism *into* `X|V` is determined by its composite with
  `ofRestrict`, since an open immersion is a monomorphism.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isIso_stalkMap_liftRestrict`: **factoring through an open
  subspace does not change the stalk maps.** The inclusion is an isomorphism on stalks, so the
  stalk map of the lift is invertible as soon as the stalk map of the morphism it factors is.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isPullback_ofRestrict`: **the restriction square is a
  pullback square**, with the morphism `X|f⁻¹V ⟶ Y|V` and its factorisation as hypotheses rather
  than as a named construction. Mathlib has the *existence* of this limit — the cospan's second
  leg is an open immersion — and does not have the square: `IsPullback` occurs nowhere under
  `Mathlib/Geometry/RingedSpace/`, which is a `git grep` of that directory at the pinned revision
  and not a claim about Mathlib as a whole.

/-- **A morphism whose image lies in an open subset factors through that open subspace.**

This is the universal property of `X|V` as an object *mapped into*, the half that
`LocallyRingedSpace.ofRestrict` on its own does not provide: `ofRestrict` says `X|V` maps to `X`,
and this says everything landing in `V` maps to `X|V`.

It is `IsOpenImmersion.lift` at `f = ofRestrict`, with `range_ofRestrict` turning the hypothesis
into the containment of images that `lift` wants.

**Stating it is worth a name because the call site it exists for meets the seam twice.** An open
of the carrier of a complex analytic space produces `TopologicalSpace.Opens.inclusion' V` at
`… ⟶ ↑X.toPresheafedSpace` rather than at `… ⟶ X.toTopCat`. The two are definitionally equal,
and **which of the two failures one meets is decided by the expected type**, not by how `V` is
spelled:

* against `Z ⟶ (X.restrict U).toLocallyRingedSpace`, which is the expected type of the
  underlying-morphism component of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftOpen` — that morphism's own
  type is `Z ⟶ X.restrict U`, and `restrict` there is the *analytic* one —
  `IsOpenImmersion.lift` reports `failed to synthesize instance of type class
  LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion (X.ofRestrict ⋯)`;
* against `Z ⟶ X.toLocallyRingedSpace.restrict V.isOpenEmbedding`, or with no expected type at
  all, the instance **is** found — `OkaTest/Nonvanishing.lean` records that as a test rather than
  as a recollection — and the `rw [range_ofRestrict]` fails instead, reporting *"did not find an
  occurrence of the pattern"* with the note that the target is not type-correct under the
  `instances` transparency level; the mismatch appears only in the `Full error:` block.

Here `V` is an ordinary argument at the locally-ringed-space spelling, both sides cross at
default transparency, the rewrite is performed once, and callers meet neither failure. -/

/-- **Factoring through an open subspace does not change the stalk maps.**

The inclusion of an open subspace is an isomorphism on stalks
(`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.ofRestrict_stalkMap_isIso`), so the two factors of
`liftRestrict_fac` differ on stalks by an isomorphism and one is invertible exactly when the
other is. This is what lets a statement about the stalks of a morphism into `X|V` be proved
about the morphism it factors, which is typically defined on the nose while the lift is opaque.

Only the direction used below is stated; the converse is `IsIso.comp_isIso` and needs no name.

**The final application is positional and that is not decoration.** With `f` written out and the
two instances supplied in order it compiles; leaving `f` to be inferred from `hcomp` does not,
and neither does an ordinary `IsIso.of_isIso_comp_left f g` with `haveI := hcomp` — nor with
`letI := hcomp` — in scope, which reports `failed to synthesize` at `IsIso (f ≫ g)`. Why is not
established here and no explanation should be read into this note; what reproduces is the
above. -/

/-- **The inclusion of an open subspace is an open immersion**, with the open passed as an
ordinary argument.

This restates an instance Mathlib already has, and it is **not** redundant. What defeats instance
search at the call site is the **head symbol**, and not the open: for a complex analytic space `X`
and `U : X.Opens` the morphism a caller holds is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofRestrict`, whose
underlying morphism is headed by `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom.toLRSHom`, where Mathlib's
instance is headed by `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.ofRestrict`. The two terms are
`rfl`-equal and they are **different discrimination-tree keys**, so the instance is never tried.

Measured at `master` = `e252f7a`, with `g` and `f` as in
`Oka/Analytification/DistinguishedOpen.lean`:

* `example : LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion ((AnalyticSpace.analytification g).ofRestrict
  (localisationOpen g f)).toLRSHom := by infer_instance` **fails**, reporting `failed to
  synthesize instance of type class LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion (AnalyticSpace.Hom.toLRSHom
  ((AnalyticSpace.analytification g).ofRestrict (localisationOpen g f)))`;
* the same goal spelled `((AnalyticSpace.analytification g).toLocallyRingedSpace.ofRestrict
  (localisationOpen g f).isOpenEmbedding)` **succeeds** by `infer_instance`, and so does the
  abstract form for an arbitrary analytic `X` and `U : X.Opens`. So the analytic `Opens` is not
  the obstruction — search reaches Mathlib's instance through it perfectly well.

So the way to use this lemma is to state the instance as an ascribed `haveI` **at the spelling the
goal uses** and close it with this: the term crosses the seam even though the search does not.
`ComplexAnalytic.isOpenImmersion_localisationProj` is the call site it exists for.

The remedy is the one `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.liftRestrict` above uses — for a
different seam, so do not read the two docstrings as one diagnosis: **wrap the Mathlib fact one
level down and pass the open as an ordinary argument, rather than repairing the instance graph.**
No new global instance, no `inferInstanceAs`, no extra discrimination-tree key. -/

/-- **The restriction square is a pullback square in `LocallyRingedSpace`.**

`liftRestrict` is the lift, `liftRestrict_fac` its factorisation, and both halves of uniqueness
are cancellation against the monomorphism `ofRestrict`; the second factorisation is not computed,
because a morphism into `Y|V` is determined by its composite with that monomorphism.

**The morphism `X|f⁻¹V ⟶ Y|V` is a hypothesis and not a construction, and that is what keeps this
theorem here.** The construction is `ComplexAnalytic.restrictHom` in
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Restrict.lean`, and it is analytic-side content: `README.md`'s mirror-tree
section says a file on a mirror path takes **nothing from the analytic side of this development**,
and both of the tests it gives — does the statement mention anything defined in this repository,
would it make sense to a reader who had never heard of Oka's theorem — fail for a statement naming
that morphism. **What rules it out is that, and not a dependency between the two files**, which
would be the wrong relation to appeal to: measured over transitive `import` lines on 2026-09-07,
neither file is in the other's closure, the closures being 8 and 3 modules under `Oka/` with each
counting the file itself. The cost of the edge that does not exist is the other half of the same
measurement, and it is what the mirror path is really protecting: the six `Oka/` modules that
importing `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Restrict.lean` here would bring in add **440** Mathlib modules to
this file's upstream target's closure of 1689, which it costs **0** today
(`scripts/import_cost.py`, same date). Hypothesising the leg costs the caller one argument it
already holds and buys the destination `README.md`'s mirror-tree section asks for.

**Mathlib has the limit and not the square.**
`LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion.hasPullback_of_right` gives
`HasPullback f (Y.ofRestrict V.isOpenEmbedding)`, because the second leg is an open
immersion, and `pullbackConeOfLeftIsLimit` builds a limiting cone for it — but that cone's apex is
the restriction of `X` to the preimage of `Set.range (Y.ofRestrict V.isOpenEmbedding)`, not to
`(Opens.map f.base).obj V`, and comparing the two is `isoOfRangeEq` and a transport. This theorem
is the square a caller holding a preimage already has, and no `HasPullback` instance is added
beside it, because Mathlib's is found: `example : HasPullback f (Y.ofRestrict V.isOpenEmbedding)
:= inferInstance` closes at `upstream/master` = `ebba2ce`.

**The analytic statement does not follow from this one and this one does not follow from it.**
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isPullback_ofRestrict` is the same square one category up, and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.forgetToLocallyRingedSpace` is faithful and not full — a morphism
of locally ringed spaces between analytic spaces need not be `ℂ`-linear — so each is a statement
about test objects the other does not see. The proof below is that one's, transcribed.

**Two of its `rw` steps do not transcribe** and are written as terms instead. For `f : X ⟶ Y` of
locally ringed spaces `f.base` is a morphism of `X.toPresheafedSpace`, while
`TopologicalSpace.Opens Y` is opens of `Y.toTopCat`; the two are definitionally equal, so
`(Opens.map f.base).obj V` elaborates, and then `rw` and `simp only` both fail on any lemma about
it, reporting that the target is not type-correct under the `instances` transparency level.
Letting the goal drive elaboration — `congrArg` against `liftRestrict_fac`, and
`liftRestrict_uniq` applied rather than rewritten — is what crosses it. This is the seam
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.liftRestrict`'s own docstring records, at a different
symptom. -/
