# Two copies of a locally ringed space glued along an open subspace

Given a locally ringed space `X` and an open `V ⊆ X`, this file glues two copies of `X` along
`V` and reads off the result: `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.double X V`, the two
inclusions, the fold map back to `X`, and when the double fails to be Hausdorff. At `X = ℂ` and
`V = ℂ ∖ {0}` it is the *line with two origins*, and the complex analytic development this mirror
file serves is what wanted it. Nothing below mentions that development, and the reason these
results are here rather than there is that none of them mentions an analytic structure.

## Why the glue datum costs nothing, and it is a fact about the index type

`CategoryTheory.GlueData'` asks for `t'` and `cocycle` **only at triples `i, j, k` that are
pairwise distinct**. The index type here is `ULift Bool`, which has no such triple, so all three
of `t'`, `t_fac` and `cocycle` are discharged by `False.elim` and the datum is nine lines. That is
the whole reason this construction is short: building the same object as a
`CategoryTheory.GlueData` directly would ask for `t'` at every triple, and the two `pullback`s it
lands between are the objects `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.restrictInfIsoPullback`
exists to get rid of.

**The price is paid at the diagonal instead**, and it is paid once.
`CategoryTheory.GlueData.ofGlueData'` fills `V (i, i)` with a `dite`, so the overlap, the
inclusion and the transition of the resulting datum are all `dite`s off which an `eqToHom` has to
be peeled. `Oka/CategoryTheory/GlueData.lean` is where that peeling lives, and
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.doubleGlueData_f_of_ne` and
`…doubleGlueData_t_comp_f_of_ne` are its two instances here — after them nothing below mentions a
`dite`.

## What the two points over a point of `X ∖ V` cost

`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.doubleGlueData_ι_base_eq_iff` is the whole topological
content: `ι i x = ι j y` exactly when `x = y` and either `i = j` or `x ∈ V`. Off the diagonal it
is `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData.ι_eq_iff` with the two `eqToHom`s peeled; on
the diagonal it is injectivity of an open immersion, which is a shorter proof than unfolding the
relation at `V (i, i)` would be.

Everything else about the underlying space follows from it and from
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData.ι_jointly_surjective`: the fold is a closed map
because the image of a set is the union of its two preimages, its fibres have at most two points,
and it is a local homeomorphism because each copy of `X` is an open set on which it inverts the
inclusion.

## Placement

This file is mirror-tree material for `Mathlib/Geometry/RingedSpace/PresheafedSpace/`: every
declaration is in `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace`, nothing here mentions complex analysis,
and the statements would make sense to a reader who had never heard of Oka's theorem.

**Upstream it would go into `Mathlib/Geometry/RingedSpace/PresheafedSpace/Gluing.lean` or into a
new file beside it, and this file's imports argue for the second.**
`python3 scripts/import_cost.py --target Mathlib.Geometry.RingedSpace.PresheafedSpace.Gluing
Mathlib.CategoryTheory.GlueData Mathlib.Topology.IsLocalHomeomorph` reports **cost 9**: the
category-theory module is already in that target's closure of 1697 and
`Mathlib/Topology/IsLocalHomeomorph.lean` is not, bringing nine modules with it —
`Mathlib.Logic.Equiv.PartialEquiv`, `Mathlib.Topology.SeparatedMap`, the five under
`Mathlib/Topology/OpenPartialHomeomorph/` (`Basic`, `Composition`, `Continuity`, `Defs`,
`IsImage`), `Mathlib.Topology.PartialHomeomorph.Defs` and `Mathlib.Topology.IsLocalHomeomorph`
itself. That is what
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isLocalHomeomorph_base_doubleFold` costs, and it is a real
argument for keeping the construction out of the API file rather than a bookkeeping figure.

The same split is what this repository wants for a second reason: this file needs
`Oka/CategoryTheory/GlueData.lean`, which `Oka/Geometry/RingedSpace/PresheafedSpace/Gluing.lean`
neither imports nor reaches — that file's `Oka`-internal import closure has four modules and this
is not one of them — so putting the material there would put it into the import closure of the
**167** repository modules downstream of that file (measured at `d2ae161`, over the 316 tracked
`.lean` modules under `Oka/` and `OkaTest/` together with `Oka.lean` and `OkaTest.lean`, with
`public import` counted).

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.doubleGlueData'`: two copies of `X`, glued along `V`, as a
  `CategoryTheory.GlueData'` — the variant that asks for the overlaps only off the diagonal.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.doubleGlueData`: the same as a
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.double`: the glued space itself.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.doubleFold`: the morphism down to `X` which restricts to
  the identity on each copy.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.doubleFoldPartialHomeomorph`: the fold read as an open
  partial homeomorphism on one copy of `X`, which is what exhibits it as a local homeomorphism.

## Main results

- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.doubleGlueData_ι_base_eq_iff`: **two points of the double
  are equal exactly when they come from the same point of `X` and either from the same copy or
  from inside `V`.**
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.ι_doubleFold`: the fold is a retraction of each copy.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isClosedMap_base_doubleFold`,
  `…finite_preimage_base_doubleFold`, `…isLocalHomeomorph_base_doubleFold` and
  `…isIso_stalkMap_doubleFold`: **the fold is closed, has finite fibres, is a local homeomorphism
  and is an isomorphism on every stalk.** Four separate statements, because they are what a
  consumer that has to check a morphism against a four-field condition asks for one at a time.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.not_t2Space_double`: **the double is not Hausdorff as soon
  as some point outside `V` is in the closure of `V`** — the two copies of that point cannot be
  separated, because any two neighbourhoods of them meet inside `V`.

## What is not here

* **No claim that the double is not Hausdorff for every `V`.** If `V` is clopen the double is the
  disjoint union of `X` and `X`, which is Hausdorff whenever `X` is; the hypothesis of
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.not_t2Space_double` is what rules that case out and it is
  not weakened here.
* **No converse**, and no statement about the double when `V = ⊤`. That case is `X` itself up to
  isomorphism and nothing below says so.
* **Nothing about `n` copies rather than two.** The construction generalises to any index type,
  but `t'` and `cocycle` stop being vacuous the moment three pairwise distinct indices exist, and
  nothing here is evidence about what they cost then.

copies are glued along `V` by the identity of `V` and by nothing else.

`t'`, `t_fac` and `cocycle` are `False.elim`: they are asked for only at triples of **pairwise
distinct** indices and `ULift Bool` has none. The `have` is stated before the structure instance
rather than three times inside it, and `decide` closes it. -/

The two statements are not one: `f i j` and `t i j ≫ f j i` are the two legs the relation of

equation is what makes the fold a closed map, and the same computation at a singleton is what
bounds its fibres. -/
