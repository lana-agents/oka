# Missing `Fin.init` and `Fin.append` lemmas

Material for `Mathlib/Data/Fin/Tuple/Basic.lean`; see the tracking issue on moving the
project's Mathlib-bound lemmas into this mirror tree.

The header names the two `Fin` operations this file has lemmas about rather than counting the
lemmas, so that appending one does not falsify it.

variable {n : ℕ} {α : Type*}

variable [Zero α]

/-- Dropping the last coordinate of the zero tuple gives the zero tuple.

This is the `simp` normal form that `Fin.init` needs: without it a goal such as
`TopologicalSpace.Opens.zero_mem_extend'` normalises to `Fin.init 0 ∈ U` and `simp` gets
stuck one rewrite short of the answer. -/

lemma init_zero : Fin.init (0 : Fin (n + 1) → α) = 0 :=

end Zero

/-- **The range of a concatenation of two tuples is the union of their ranges.**

`Fin.append_left` and `Fin.append_right` say what `Fin.append` does at each of the two families
of indices, and `Fin.addCases` says those are all the indices; this is the two of them read as a
statement about the image, which is the form a consumer indexing a span or a `∀` by a
concatenated family needs. -/
