# The refined `hrange` at the triples whose three members are not all different

`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumTransition.lean` settles the range law of a cross-member refined
cover datum at a triple `(a, b, c)` whose three members `σ a`, `σ b`, `σ c` are pairwise
different, up to one containment in the caller's own `D(q b c)`. Its `## What is not here` says
why the rest of the law is not that argument with a hypothesis dropped:

> **`hrange` itself, and it is not one case away.** … The mixed triples — `σ a = σ b` with `σ c`
> different, and the two others — are untouched, and they are not this argument with a hypothesis
> dropped: `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlue` takes its equal branch there, whose triangle
> (`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlueEq_analytification_comp`) is over a *member* and not over an
> overlap, so the square below has no statement at those triples, let alone a proof.

**Both halves of that are right and neither is an obstruction.** A triangle over a member is
exactly what `Oka/Analytification/CoverRefinement.lean` discharges *both* geometric laws from at a
constant `σ` — `ComplexAnalytic.refineTransitionHom_localisationProj` — and what was missing is
that statement for a general `σ` at the pairs where it happens to be equal.
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumTransitionHom_localisationProj_of_eq` below is it, and with it the
four remaining shapes separate, one of them into a theorem with no hypothesis at all.

## The four shapes, and what each one costs

Which branch `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlue` takes at `(a, b)` is decided by `σ a = σ b`; which
form the target `D(f_bc)` takes is decided by `σ b = σ c`. Beyond the pairwise-different triple
that leaves four:

* **`σ a = σ b = σ c`.** Equal branch, equal target, and the law **holds outright** —
  `ComplexAnalytic.range_refineDatumTransitionHom_subset_of_eq`. Neither the caller's `q` nor the
  original datum's own `hrange` is read. The transition does not move a point of the member, and
  the point is in `D(fam c)` already because it is in the refined `a`-`c` overlap. That is
  `ComplexAnalytic.refineHrange`'s sentence, at a `σ` which is equal at these three indices and
  arbitrary elsewhere.
* **`σ a = σ c` with `σ a ≠ σ b`.** Cross branch, cross target, and **the original datum's
  `hrange` is not read here either.** `ComplexAnalytic.range_coverTransitionHom_subset` puts the
  image in `D(f_{σb σa})` whatever the input is, and `σ c = σ a` makes that the open the law asks
  for. Where the pairwise-different triple spends the original law, this one spends the
  unconditional half of it.
* **`σ a = σ b` with `σ b ≠ σ c`.** Equal branch, cross target. The free half is there and comes
  from the *source*: the point is in `D(f_{σa σc})` because it is in the refined `a`-`c` overlap,
  and `σ a = σ b` carries that to `D(f_{σb σc})`.
* **`σ b = σ c` with `σ a ≠ σ b`.** Cross branch, **equal target**, and **there is no free half.**
  The law asks the image to land in `D(fam c)`, which is the caller's refining family and not the
  original datum's polynomial, so nothing about the original cover bears on it.
  `ComplexAnalytic.range_refineDatumTransitionHom_subset_iff_of_eq_bc` is therefore an equivalence
  whose right-hand side is the *whole* law and not a residue, which is the one place on this line
  where those two readings differ.

**So the residue is the same at three of the four shapes and different at the fourth**, and that
is the finding worth carrying: at every triple with `σ b ≠ σ c` what is left of `hrange` is the
containment in `D(q b c)` that `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumTransition.lean` already isolated,
and only the source of the free half changes.
`ComplexAnalytic.range_refineDatumTransitionHom_subset_iff_of_ne_bc` is that statement with the
free half taken as a hypothesis; the two shape-specific corollaries below supply it, and that
file's `ComplexAnalytic.range_refineDatumTransitionHom_subset_iff` is the third instance of it and
is **not** reproved here.

## The transport, and why it is a named `def`

The equal branch's triangle ends over `obj (σ a)` where the law is stated over `obj (σ b)`, so the
statement carries an identification of the two members as its last factor.
`ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq` is that factor, and it exists as a type-ascribed `def` for the
reason `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumCrossProjSpace` does — **this is that reason's second site, and
it bites harder here.** Written out as
`AnalyticSpace.forgetToLocallyRingedSpace.map (analytificationFunctor.map (eqToHom …))` the factor
has type `forgetToLocallyRingedSpace.obj (analytificationFunctor.obj (obj (σ a))) ⟶ …` where
`ComplexAnalytic.coverSpace` is asked for, and the two agree only by unfolding a semireducible
definition. The goal is then ill-typed at `instances` transparency, and what fails is not the step
that mentions the factor: **`rw` refuses a pattern it can see, five factors away, and
`simp only [CategoryTheory.Functor.map_comp]` leaves the whole side of an equation unsplit.** Both
were measured on the way to `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumTransitionHom_localisationProj_of_eq`, and
in both the error names a pattern that is visibly present. Ascribing the type once removes both,
and no proof below has to mention either spelling.

`ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq_refl` is what the two transport lemmas run on: with the two
indices abstract, `subst` reduces the identification to the identity, and the two `▸`s in the
statements then disappear by proof irrelevance rather than by a rewrite. That is why those lemmas
are stated at abstract `i`, `j`, `k` in the index type rather than at `σ a`, `σ b`, `σ c`, where
nothing is a variable and `subst` has nothing to eliminate.

## The `simp` discipline, and this is the recorded defect's fourth site

`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumTransition.lean` records three routes by which a tactic plants an
equation or congruence lemma into the module that ran it, the third being a `simp only` naming no
definition at all — `[LocallyRingedSpace.comp_base, TopCat.hom_comp, ContinuousMap.comp_apply]` —
which traverses a goal mentioning a definition whose arguments include proofs. **The first draft
of this file ran that same `simp only` in the two range proofs below and planted two congruence
lemmas**, one for `ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq` and one for
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlue`, which belongs to
`Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberDatumGlue.lean`. The build was green and `Δdump` was `+16` where
the draft declared fourteen things.

The cure is that file's: the bridge is `rfl`, so
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumTripleIncl_localisationProj_apply_of_eq` states the composite applied
to a point with its type written out and proves it by `congrArg`, and no tactic below has to
traverse either term. `Δdump` here is now **+15**, the number of declarations, and that is the
figure to check a branch on this file by.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq`: **two members the index map sends two indices to,
  identified**, as a morphism of `ComplexAnalytic.coverSpace`.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq_refl`: **the identification at `rfl` is the identity**, which
  is the whole content of the two transport lemmas.
- `ComplexAnalytic.mem_localisationOpen_coverSpaceHomOfEq` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.mem_coverOpen_coverSpaceHomOfEq`: **the identification carries a distinguished
  open to the corresponding one**, once for a polynomial of the refining family and once for one
  of the original datum.
- `ComplexAnalytic.coverOpen_refineDatumPoly_of_eq`: **the refined overlap of two members lying
  over one is the preimage of `D(fam b)`**, the mirror of
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverOpen_refineDatumPoly_of_ne`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumTransitionHom_localisationProj_of_eq`: **the equal branch's
  transition lies over its member.** The statement whose absence the bullet quoted above records,
  and the counterpart at a general `σ` of
  `ComplexAnalytic.refineTransitionHom_localisationProj`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumTripleIncl_localisationProj_of_eq` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumTripleIncl_localisationProj_apply_of_eq`: **the same restricted to a
  triple overlap**, and then read at a point of it, which is the form the two range statements
  below consume and the form that keeps a `simp only` from planting two congruence lemmas.
- `ComplexAnalytic.range_refineDatumTransitionHom_subset_of_eq`: **`hrange` at a triple whose
  three members are all equal**, with no hypothesis on the caller's `q`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.range_refineDatumTransitionHom_localisationProj_subset_of_eq_ac` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.range_refineDatumTransitionHom_localisationProj_subset_of_eq_ab`: **the free
  half at the two mixed triples that have one**, from the unconditional half of the original
  transition law and from the source's own second overlap respectively.
- `ComplexAnalytic.range_refineDatumTransitionHom_subset_iff_of_ne_bc`: **wherever `σ b ≠ σ c`,
  the law is the free half and one containment in `D(q b c)`** — the residue, isolated once and
  with the free half as a hypothesis.
- `ComplexAnalytic.range_refineDatumTransitionHom_subset_iff_of_eq_ac` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.range_refineDatumTransitionHom_subset_iff_of_eq_ab`: **that residue at the two
  shapes**, with the free half discharged.
- `ComplexAnalytic.range_refineDatumTransitionHom_subset_iff_of_eq_bc`: **and where `σ b = σ c`
  the law is equivalent to a containment in `D(fam c)`, which is the whole of it.**

## What is not here

* **No single `hrange`, and so no `hcocycle`.** This file produces one theorem and three
  equivalences at four disjoint shapes, not one proof of the law; and
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverTriple` takes `hrange` as an argument, so the cocycle law of the refined
  datum mentions such a proof three times in its own statement. Assembling the shapes needs a
  hypothesis on `q`, which is the next bullet, and the assembly is a decision nothing here makes.
* **No hypothesis on `q`, and no refined cover datum.** As in
  `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumTransition.lean`: nothing here adopts a right-hand side as an
  assumption, and `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData` is still unreachable at a non-constant `σ`,
  which asks for all three laws at once.
* **Nothing about the fourth shape's residue.** That `D(fam c)` containment relates the caller's
  extra factor to the caller's refining family, and this file says only that it is what the law
  asks — not whether `ComplexAnalytic.exists_refineDatumCross`'s choice satisfies it, in either
  direction.
* **The pairwise-different triple is not reproved.**
  `ComplexAnalytic.range_refineDatumTransitionHom_subset_iff` stands where it is and is an
  instance of `ComplexAnalytic.range_refineDatumTransitionHom_subset_iff_of_ne_bc` here; the
  earlier file is not opened.
* **Nothing about `hsymm`**, which is `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlue_symm`
  (`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumSymm.lean`) and is algebraic where everything here is
  geometric.
* **No scheme and no `admissible`**, as in the files this one sits beside.

/-- **At `rfl` the identification is the identity**, which is all either transport lemma below
uses.

Both functors carry the identity to the identity, and `eqToHom` of `congrArg obj rfl` is the
identity already. It is a term and not a `rw`: the goal is ill-typed at `instances` transparency
for the reason the definition above is ascribed, and a `rw` chain fails on `𝟙` where an `exact`
does not. -/

Stated at abstract indices rather than at `σ a`, `σ b`, `σ c` **because that is what makes `subst`
available**: at the latter nothing is a variable. After the two substitutions the remaining
transport is along a proof of `i = i`, which is `rfl` by proof irrelevance, so the two sides are
the same membership and nothing has to be rewritten. -/

/-- **The refined overlap of two members lying over one member is the preimage of `D(fam b)`**

`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumPoly_of_eq` and `ComplexAnalytic.localisationOpen_rename`, in that
order and nothing else — the mirror of `ComplexAnalytic.coverOpen_refineDatumPoly_of_ne`, and
shorter than it because there is no product to split: the diagonal normalisation has already
removed the datum's own polynomial from this branch.

The `change` is what lets the rewrite reach `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumPoly` under
`ComplexAnalytic.coverOpen`, for the reason that theorem's proof records. -/

/-! ### The equal branch's transition, over its member -/

/-- **The refined transition lies over its member**, where the two refined members lie over one:
going from the `a`-th refined member to the `b`-th and then down is going down and identifying the
two members.

This is `ComplexAnalytic.refineTransitionHom_localisationProj` at a general `σ`, and the
identification is the only difference — at a constant `σ` the two members are the same object and
the last factor is the identity by `ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq_refl`.

The proof is that theorem's, with `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlue_of_eq` naming the branch the
field takes at such a pair: unfold both transitions, cancel the two outer comparison isomorphisms
with `ComplexAnalytic.coverOverlapIso_hom_coverIncl`, and what is left is
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlueEq_analytification_comp` carried down by
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.forgetToLocallyRingedSpace`. The functor is applied to the equation
rather than the equation rewritten under it, for the reason recorded at both. -/

/-! ### `hrange` where the three members are equal -/

/-- **`hrange` for the refined datum at a triple whose three members are equal**, and it holds
outright: no hypothesis on the caller's `q`, and the original datum's own `hrange` is not read.

**This is `ComplexAnalytic.refineHrange`'s one sentence about points**, at a `σ` that is equal at
these three indices and arbitrary elsewhere. The transition does not move the point of the member
it lies over, and that point is in `D(fam c)` already because the starting point is in the refined
`a`-`c` overlap; `ComplexAnalytic.coverOpen_refineDatumPoly_of_eq` is what says so at both ends
and `ComplexAnalytic.mem_localisationOpen_coverSpaceHomOfEq` is what crosses the identification of
the two members.

It is not a corollary of that theorem: `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlue` is the field of a datum
built over a general `σ`, and only `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlue_of_eq` — inside
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumTransitionHom_localisationProj_of_eq` above — says which branch it

/-! ### The free half at the two mixed triples that have one -/

/-- **The free half where `σ a = σ c` and `σ a ≠ σ b`, and the original datum's `hrange` is not
what supplies it.**

`ComplexAnalytic.range_coverTransitionHom_subset` says the original transition from `σ a` to `σ b`
lands in `D(f_{σb σa})` whatever the input is, and `σ c = σ a` is what makes that the open the
refined law asks for. So where the pairwise-different triple spends the original law — through
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumCrossTriple` and
`ComplexAnalytic.range_refineDatumTransitionHom_localisationProj_subset` — this shape spends only
its unconditional half, and needs no lift of the refined triple overlap at all. -/

The transition lies over its member by
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumTripleIncl_localisationProj_of_eq`, so the image point is the point
the starting point already lay over, identified across the two members. That point is in
`D(f_{σa σc})` because the starting point is in the refined `a`-`c` overlap — the first factor of
`ComplexAnalytic.coverOpen_refineDatumPoly_of_ne`, the caller's `q a c` being discarded — and
`ComplexAnalytic.mem_coverOpen_coverSpaceHomOfEq` carries that to `D(f_{σb σc})`. The original
datum's `hrange` is not read here either. -/

/-! ### What is left, at each shape -/

/-- **Wherever `σ b ≠ σ c`, the refined law is the free half and one containment in `D(q b c)`**,
whichever branch the field takes at `(a, b)` and wherever the free half came from.

`ComplexAnalytic.coverOpen_refineDatumPoly_of_ne` splits the target in two and the hypothesis
discharges the first, which is the argument
`ComplexAnalytic.range_refineDatumTransitionHom_subset_iff` makes at a pairwise-different triple.
**It is stated with the free half as a hypothesis because that is the part that differs between
the three shapes it covers** — the original datum's `hrange` there, the unconditional half of the
transition law at `σ a = σ c`, the source's own second overlap at `σ a = σ b` — while the residue
does not differ at all. That earlier theorem is the instance of this one at a pairwise-different
triple and is not reproved here. -/
