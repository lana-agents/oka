# The presentation of a distinguished open depends on the polynomial only up to a unique iso

`ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentation g f` adjoins a variable and the equation `t·f - 1`, so
the polynomial `f` occurs in the *type* of everything built from it: two polynomials cutting out
the same distinguished open give two different objects of `ComplexAnalytic.Presentation` and two
different analytic spaces. This file says they are canonically the same one.

The first four statements identify the two presentations and put the identification over the
member; the next four are about the case where the two polynomials differ by a **unit**, and about
where such a pair comes from; the last two vary the base rather than the polynomial:

* `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentationIsoOfDvdPow` — **the presentations of the localisation
  at `f` and at `f'` are isomorphic** whenever the images of `f` and `f'` in `A` each divide a
  power of the other, which is the algebraic form of *"`f` and `f'` cut out the same distinguished
  open"*.
* `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentedAlgebraEquiv_localisationRingHom` — **the identification
  with `Localization.Away` commutes with the structure map** `A ⟶ A_f`. This is what makes the
  first isomorphism canonical rather than merely available, and it is proved without an
  `Algebra (ComplexAnalytic.PresentedAlgebra n k g)` instance on the localised presented algebra:
  see *The shape this settles* below.
* `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentedAlgebraEquivOfDvdPow_localisationRingHom` — **the
  isomorphism of the first bullet is one of `A`-algebras**: it carries `A ⟶ A_f` to `A ⟶ A_{f'}`.
  Without this the two structure maps are unrelated and the isomorphism, though canonical, says
  nothing about the presentations *as distinguished opens of the same member*.
* `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentationIsoOfDvdPow_hom_comp` — **the triangle**: the same
  statement in `ComplexAnalytic.Presentation`, as an equation between morphisms. This is the form
  a coherence law consumes, and it is the sense in which a transition morphism built from a
  witness does not depend on the witness.
* `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentationIsoOfUnitMul` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentationIsoOfUnitMul_hom_comp` — **the same two at a unit
  multiple**, which is the pair of divisibilities at exponent one and is the form the statement
  below produces.
* `ComplexAnalytic.isUnit_mk_rename_localisationIncl` — **the polynomial that was inverted is a
  unit upstairs**, which is the last equation of `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentation` read
  as an invertibility.
* `ComplexAnalytic.exists_mk_rename_eq` — **every polynomial of a localisation is a unit multiple
  of a renamed polynomial of the base.** This is the algebraic form of
  `ComplexAnalytic.exists_localisationOpen_eq_rename`, whose geometric conclusion discards the
  unit; the unit is what the isomorphism above needs and what an equality of non-vanishing loci
  does not give.
* `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentationIsoOfAlgEquiv` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentationIsoOfAlgEquiv_hom_comp` — **the base moves too**: an
  isomorphism of two presented algebras carrying one cutting polynomial to the other identifies
  the two localisations, over that isomorphism. Everything before this keeps the base fixed, and a
  cross-member overlap of a refined cover is the case where it does not.

## Where this is needed

Taxis #996. `Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Cover/Directed.lean`'s locally directed cover — the shape
a scheme actually supplies, and the one
`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Sites/SmallAffineZariski.lean` instantiates for every scheme with no
hypotheses — indexes the members of a cover by a *category* and asks for a transition morphism per
**arrow**. An arrow of that index category is a proof of `∃ f, X.basicOpen f = U`, and it is
proof-irrelevant: the section `f` witnessing it is neither recoverable from it nor unique. On this
side the polynomial is in the type, so a transition built from a witness has to be shown
independent of the witness. That is the first statement above.

## The shape this settles, and it is a choice among two

Building the analytification of a locally directed cover can be done **choice-first** — pick a
presentation for each member and a witness for each arrow, then prove the functoriality laws up to
the coherence isomorphisms — or **choice-free**, building each member as a colimit over all its
presentations so that no choice is made and the laws hold on the nose.

**Choice-first, and the reason is stronger than "the choices are isomorphic".** The isomorphism
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentedAlgebraEquivOfDvdPow` is
`IsLocalization.algEquiv`, transported: it is not *an* isomorphism between the two localisations
but **the unique `A`-algebra map** between them, since both are localisations of `A` at the same
saturated submonoid. Uniqueness is what discharges a coherence law, and it is available here
because the second statement above puts the identification over `A` rather than only over `ℂ`. The
colimit construction would buy the same laws at the price of machinery this development has no
other use for.

## What is not here

**No transition morphism, and no locally directed cover.** Nothing below mentions
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme`, and the file adds no Mathlib import: `Cover/Directed.lean` is not
imported, so its declarations cannot even be named in a docstring here — which is why the two
Mathlib files above are cited by path.

**No composite of two localisations.** The second half of taxis #996 is that the witness of a
composite arrow is a third polynomial, and its algebra is `IsLocalization.Away.mul`, already in
Mathlib. What is missing is the transport of that statement to
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentation`, and the obstruction is recorded in
`Oka/Analytification/DistinguishedOpen.lean`'s docstring for
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentedAlgebraEquiv`: there is deliberately no
`Algebra (ComplexAnalytic.PresentedAlgebra n k g)` instance on the localised presented algebra,
so `IsLocalization.Away.mul` cannot be applied to it directly. The compatibility proved here is
what such a transport would be built from.

/-! ### Associates, and the polynomials of a localisation up to one

The hypotheses of `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentationIsoOfDvdPow` are two divisibilities of
*powers*, which is the weakest form that still gives the isomorphism. The two statements below are
about the case where one polynomial is a **unit multiple** of the other — both divisibilities at
exponent one — and about where such a pair comes from.

**Where it comes from is the point.** `ComplexAnalytic.exists_pow_mul_eq_rename`
(`Oka/Analytification/DistinguishedOpen.lean`) proves an equation in the polynomial ring, and
`ComplexAnalytic.exists_localisationOpen_eq_rename` reads off the geometric half of it: two
polynomials cut out the same open. **That discards the algebra**, and the algebra is what a
transition morphism needs — an equality of non-vanishing loci does not give a divisibility over a
general presented `ℂ`-algebra, which would be a Nullstellensatz statement and is proved nowhere
here. Read modulo the ideal, the same equation says the two polynomials are *associates*, and that
is what `ComplexAnalytic.exists_mk_rename_eq` records.
-/

/-- **A unit multiple gives the isomorphism**, at exponent one in both directions.

`ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentationIsoOfDvdPow` asks for `∃ N, q' ∣ q ^ N` and its mirror;
a unit multiple gives both with `N = M = 1`, since `q = q' * u⁻¹` and `q' = q * u`.

**Why this is a `def` taking `u` and `hu`, and not `∃ Q, Nonempty (_ ≅ _)`.** The existence form
is the one a spike writes, because it is one statement; it is the wrong one here, and the reason
is what the arguments buy rather than a preference for data over propositions:

* **A glue is built out of the isomorphism, not out of its existence.** A cover datum's `glue`
  field is an `Iso`, and `ComplexAnalytic.coverTransition` transports it; `Nonempty` gives a
  consumer nothing to transport, and `Classical.choice` on it would produce an isomorphism no
  second consumer could recognise as the same one.
* **The witness is what makes two calls agree.** Two consumers holding the same `Q`, `u` and `hu`
  get the *same* isomorphism here, so a coherence law between them is statable; an existential
  re-chosen at each call site is not, and coherence between two transitions is the whole content
  of the laws such a datum has to satisfy.
* **The triangle needs the same arguments.**
  `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentationIsoOfUnitMul_hom_comp` below is about *this*
  isomorphism at *these* arguments, and it is what says it is one over the member the two opens
  sit in.

`ComplexAnalytic.exists_mk_rename_eq` is where the three arguments come from, and the split
between the two is exactly `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentationIsoOfDvdPow`'s own: a `def`
taking hypotheses, and a separate existence producing them. -/

non-vanishing locus does not see a non-vanishing factor, but a divisibility does, and the unit is
what a consumer feeds to `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentationIsoOfUnitMul`.

The two statements are not interchangeable, and the direction that fails is worth naming: this
one gives the equality of opens (a unit does not vanish), and the equality of opens does **not**

statement and nothing in this repository proves it. -/

/-! ### Two presentations identified, and the localisations carried across

Everything above keeps the **base** fixed and varies the polynomial. This section varies the base:
given an isomorphism of two presented algebras carrying one cutting polynomial to the other, the
two localisations are isomorphic over it.

**That is the case a cross-member overlap is in.** In `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData'` the overlap
of two members is presented once on each side and the datum's `glue` identifies the two — an
isomorphism of two *different* presentations. Refining such a cover localises both sides again,
and nothing above can cross between them, because every statement above is about one base.

The commutative algebra is Mathlib's: `IsLocalization.algEquivOfAlgEquiv` transports a
localisation along an isomorphism of the bases matching the submonoids, and for
`Localization.Away` the submonoid condition is `Submonoid.map_powers`, a `simp` lemma. What is
here is the transport of that statement to this development's presentations, and the fact that it
is one **over the two members**, which is what the isomorphism is used for and what the
isomorphism alone does not say.
