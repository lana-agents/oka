# The cocycle law of a cross-member refinement, and the analytic space it leaves unconditional

`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumGlueData.lean` assembles the range law of a cross-member refined
cover datum out of five shape theorems and names the last law, `ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumCocycle`
— *"named here and proved nowhere"*, and *"nothing on this line is evidence about it in either
direction"*. **This file proves it.** With `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumHcocycle` the three laws a
refinement needs are all theorems at a general `σ`, and
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumAnalytificationOfLaws` is the analytic space a cross-member refinement
glues to, asking a caller for nothing but the original cover's own three laws and the two
conditions that file adopted.

## The obstruction on record, and which half of it was right

Four files say some version of `Oka/Analytification/CoverRefinement.lean`'s sentence — *"`hcocycle`
keeps the clause, for the reason the paragraph above gives — the cancellation is against the
projection of the one fixed member"*. **The outer cancellation is not what fails, and it transfers
with the fixed member replaced by the member the *first* index lies over.**
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumCocycle_of_localisationProj` is that step at a general `σ`: a morphism
into the `a`-th refined triple overlap is determined by its composite into
`obj (σ a)^an`, because that overlap is an open subspace and
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationProj` is an open immersion — and neither fact knows where `σ` sends
`b` or `c`. What has no analogue is `ComplexAnalytic.refineTriple_localisationProj`, which reads
all three transitions of the triple over *one* member; at a general `σ` they lie over three.

## What replaces it, and the finding is which law each shape spends

The composite is read down one edge at a time. Each edge has two shapes and each is a square that
already exists: at `σ a ≠ σ b` the transition lies over the original datum's own
`ComplexAnalytic.coverTransitionHom` (`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumTransition.lean`), and at
`σ a = σ b` it lies over its member across an identification
(`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumRange.lean`). Those are
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumTriple_localisationProj_of_ne` and
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumTriple_localisationProj_of_eq` below, and they are the whole of the
intermediate statement.

The triple then splits into the same five shapes the range law splits into — the split is the
triple's and not either law's — and **the three of them turn out to spend three different things**:

* **pairwise different members**: the original datum's own `hcocycle`, through the lift
  `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumCrossTriple` and the square
  `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumCrossTriple_coverTriple` below, which says the refined triple
  transition lies over the original one;
* **exactly one pair of members equal**: the original datum's own **`hsymm`**, and *not* its
  `hcocycle`. The three edges compose to a pair going out and back rather than to a triple of the
  original datum's, and they have to: with `σ a = σ b` the original index triple is
  `(σ a, σ a, σ c)`, which `ComplexAnalytic.coverTriple` does not accept. What cancels is
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverTransition_hom_comp`, added to `Oka/Analytification/AffineCover.lean`
  rather than here;
* **all three members equal**: neither, exactly as the range law's all-equal shape reads neither
  condition. The composite is three identifications of one member with itself.

**So the count of the original datum's laws this file consumes is three and not one**, and the
sentence those four files carry — that the obstruction is one cancellation against one fixed member
— named the wrong step and understated what the mixed shapes cost.

## No `CategoryTheory.reassoc_of%` below, and that is not a style choice

Every proof here walks a three-fold composite one factor at a time, which is what `reassoc_of%` is
for; **it is not used, because it plants congruence lemmas.** Measured on this file: with the four
`reassoc_of%`s the obvious draft has, `scripts/DumpOkaDecls.lean` reports `Δdump` of `+31` for 27
declarations, and the four extra rows are the `congr_simp` companions of
`ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq`, `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlue`,
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumCrossTriple` and `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumTripleCross` — three of
them on *other files'* definitions.
That is the hazard `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumRange.lean` records at a `simp only`, at a
fifth site and reached by a fourth route: `reassoc_of%` normalises with `simp`, and every
definition here with a proof argument that occurs in the goal gets one.

What replaces it is `(Category.assoc _ _ _).symm.trans (e =≫ _)`, which is `reassoc_of%`'s
statement built as a *term* out of `CategoryTheory.eq_whisker` and associativity, consults no
simp set and normalises nothing. The cost is that its right-hand side is left as the equation's
own, so each use is followed by a `Category.assoc` the elaborated form would have done — that, and
nothing else, is why the rewrite chains below are longer than they look as though they need to be.
`Δdump` is `+27` and `comm -23` is empty.

## The transports, and why they are stated at abstract indices

The three mixed shapes each need the pair cancellation across an equality of members, and the
equality is between `σ a` and `σ b` — terms, not variables, so `subst` is unavailable where they
are used. `ComplexAnalytic.coverTransitionHom_of_fac_eq_ab`,
`ComplexAnalytic.coverTransitionHom_of_fac_eq_bc` and
`ComplexAnalytic.coverTransitionHom_of_fac_eq_ac` are therefore stated at abstract `i`, `j`, `k`
with the equality as a hypothesis, where `subst` *is* available and reduces all three to
`ComplexAnalytic.coverTransitionHom_of_fac`. This is the move
`ComplexAnalytic.mem_localisationOpen_coverSpaceHomOfEq` makes in
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumRange.lean`, for the same reason. (This sentence read *"one file
up"*; that file is **two** import edges up, through
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumGlueData.lean`.)

## Where the helper lemmas this file needed were put, and why the two answers differ

Three lemmas this file's proofs run on are not in it, and one that is could be read as belonging
elsewhere. The rule applied is **the file that owns the vocabulary**, not the file that consumes
it, and it separates them:

* `ComplexAnalytic.coverTransition_hom_comp` — `t i j ≫ t j i = 𝟙` — is in
  `Oka/Analytification/AffineCover.lean`, which declares `ComplexAnalytic.coverTransition` and
  already holds `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueIso_symm`, the same statement one level down. Its only
  consumer is this file, **ten import edges below it with nine modules in between**, and it went
  up anyway. (This bullet read *"four files downstream"* until the distance was measured. Four is
  the gap from `Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberDatumGlue.lean`, which is neither endpoint here.)
* `ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq_trans`, `ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq_self` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq_comp_symm` are in
  `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumRange.lean` for the same reason: that file declares
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq` and holds `ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq_refl` beside
  it, and the three are the groupoid facts about a transport, whose statements say nothing about a
  triple. This file is their only consumer. **They were written here first and moved**, which is
  why their guards are in this file's section of `OkaTest/Axioms/Analytification.lean`.
* `ComplexAnalytic.coverTransitionHom_of_fac_eq_ab`,
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverTransitionHom_of_fac_eq_bc` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverTransitionHom_of_fac_eq_ac` **stay here**, and that is not an
  inconsistency. They are stated with two morphisms and a factorisation hypothesis *because that
  is the form a triple's edges arrive in* — the paragraph above is the whole reason they exist —
  so they are consumer-shaped, and `Oka/Analytification/AffineCover.lean` would carry a statement
  written for a caller it does not know about.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumTripleProj`: **the refined triple overlap read down on the member
  its first index lies over** — the mono everything is cancelled against.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumTripleCross`: the same overlap read into the original datum's own
  overlap, where the two members are different.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlueDataOfLaws` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumAnalytificationOfLaws`: **the refined cover's glue data and analytic
  space with no law left over**, taking the original datum's three laws and the two adopted
  conditions and nothing else.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumHcocycle`: **the cocycle law of a cross-member refined cover datum**,
  at every triple and at a general `σ`. This is the file.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumTriple_localisationProj_of_ne` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumTriple_localisationProj_of_eq`: **the intermediate statement**, one
  edge of the triple at a time, in the two shapes an edge has.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumCocycle_of_localisationProj`: **the outer cancellation**, which is
  the step four files said has no analogue and which has one.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumCrossTriple_coverTriple`: **the refined triple transition lies over
  the original one**, where the three members are pairwise different.
- `ComplexAnalytic.coverTransitionHom_of_fac`: **out along a transition and back is the
  inclusion**, in the factorised form the three mixed shapes consume.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumAnalytificationOfLaws_toLocallyRingedSpace`: the space is the glue
  data's gluing, with no transport.

## What is not here

* **No witness.** There is still no example of a refined cover datum at a non-constant `σ`, which
  is taxis #1107's fourth deliverable, and nothing here discharges either of the two conditions
  `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumGlueData.lean` adopts — whether
  `ComplexAnalytic.exists_refineDatumCross`'s choice satisfies them is untouched in both
  directions. **What this file removes is the last law, not the last hypothesis**: the two
  conditions are the hypothesis, and `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumHrange_iff` says no weaker pair
  will do.
* **Nothing that says the refined cover's analytic space is the original one.** It is a space, and
  `ComplexAnalytic.not_isIso_refineToBase` says at a constant `σ` that the comparison need not be
  an isomorphism; there is no morphism between the two gluings here in either direction.
* **No `hrange` reproved and no shape statement reopened.**
  `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumGlueData.lean`,
  `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumRange.lean` and
  `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumTransition.lean` are consumed and not opened.
* **The scheme side, `admissible`, and the comparison functor**, as in the files this one sits
  beside.

/-! ### Out along a transition and back -/

/-- **Out along the transition from `i` to `j` and back is the inclusion**, in the form the mixed
shapes below consume: a morphism into the `j`-`i` overlap that lies over the transition of one into
the `i`-`j` overlap comes back, along the transition the other way, to that one included.

`ComplexAnalytic.coverIncl` is an open immersion and so a monomorphism, which is what identifies
the second morphism as the first followed by `ComplexAnalytic.coverTransition`; then
`ComplexAnalytic.coverTransition_hom_comp` is the whole content, and it is the original datum's
`hsymm` and nothing else.

**Stated with the two morphisms rather than as an equation between the two transitions** because
that is how the composite around a triple arrives: each of the three edges is known only through
its composite with an inclusion, never on the nose. -/

/-- **The pair cancellation where the equal members are the triple's first two**, which is the
shape `σ a = σ b`.

The transport is the only difference from `ComplexAnalytic.coverTransitionHom_of_fac`: the morphism
that comes back lands in the member `i`, the inclusion available is the one at `k`, and the two are
the same member. **Stated at abstract `i`, `j`, `k` because that is what makes `subst` available** —
at the call site the equality is between `σ a` and `σ b`, which are terms and not variables, and
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumRange.lean` records the same reason for the same move. -/

/-- **The refined triple overlap read down on the member its first index lies over.**

This is the mono the cocycle law is cancelled against, and it is the whole of what replaces "the
projection of the one fixed member": the `a`-th refined member is `D(fam a)` inside
`obj (σ a)^an` whatever `σ` does elsewhere, and the triple overlap is an open subspace of it.

A `def` and not an `abbrev` deliberately, and the difference is measured: with an `abbrev`,
`CategoryTheory.reassoc_of%` normalises through the reducible definition and produces a pattern in
which this composite is split and reassociated, against goals in which it is not, and the rewrites
below fail to match. The unfolding lemma next to it is what the two proofs that need to open it
use, which is the construction `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumCrossPart_eq` and
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumCrossTriple_eq` already use in this line of files, and for the further
reason they give: a `rw` at the definition itself plants an auto-generated equation lemma under
its own name. -/

/-! ### The outer cancellation -/

/-- **The cocycle law at one triple follows from its descent onto the first member.**

**This is the step four files say has no analogue, and it has one.** A morphism into the `a`-th
refined triple overlap is determined by its composite with the inclusion into the `a`-th refined
member (`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.hom_ext_restrict`), and a morphism into that member
is determined by its composite with the projection down to `obj (σ a)^an`, because
`ComplexAnalytic.isOpenImmersion_localisationProj` makes that projection a monomorphism. **Neither
step knows where `σ` sends `b` or `c`**: the cancellation is against the *first* index's own
member and not against a fixed one, and at a constant `σ` those are the same thing, which is why
`Oka/Analytification/CoverRefinement.lean`'s proof reads as though it were about a fixed member.
What that file's `ComplexAnalytic.refineHcocycle` does after this step is what has no analogue,
and the two edge statements above are what replace it. -/

/-! ### The shape where all three members are equal -/

/-- **The descended cocycle law where the three members are equal**, and it holds outright: no
hypothesis on the caller's `q`, and neither of the original datum's two geometric laws is read.

Three equal edges, three identifications, and
`ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq_trans` twice composes them into one along a proof of
`σ a = σ a`, which `ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq_self` is the identity along. **The all-equal
shape of the range law reads neither adopted condition, and this is the matching fact for the
cocycle law**: at a triple lying over one member a cross-member refinement costs nothing at all.

`obj (σ b)^an`: on the left the unequal edge's descent, on the right
`ComplexAnalytic.coverTriple_fac` and
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumCrossTriple_coverTripleIncl`, and the two meet at
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumTripleCross`.

**This is the statement `Oka/Analytification/CoverRefinement.lean` predicted could not exist** —

do; what they have instead is the original datum's own triple overlap over them, and that is a

/-! ### The three shapes with exactly one pair of members equal -/

/-- **The descended cocycle law where the first two members are equal and the third is
different.**

The three edges are, in order, equal, unequal and unequal, and **what they compose to is a pair of
the original datum's transitions going out and coming back** — not a triple of them, and there
could not be one: the original index triple here is `(σ a, σ a, σ c)`, which
`ComplexAnalytic.coverTriple` does not accept. So what this shape spends is the original datum's
**`hsymm`**, through `ComplexAnalytic.coverTransitionHom_of_fac_eq_ab`, and its `hcocycle` is not
read at all.

The two unequal edges are identified as morphisms into the original datum's overlaps by
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumTripleCross_coverIncl`, which is the only way a composite of lifts is
known here; the equal edge contributes the identification, and its inverse comes back out of the
cancellation, so `ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq_comp_symm` closes it. -/

line was evidence about it in either direction. It is a theorem, and it asks a caller for exactly
the original datum's own three laws: `hsymm`, `hrange` and `hcocycle`.

The case split is the same five shapes the range law splits into, in the same order and with the
same `by_cases` structure, and **that is a structural fact about a triple and not a coincidence of
either law**: `σ a = σ b` and `σ b = σ c` force `σ a = σ c`, so of the eight combinations only five
occur. **Note which hypothesis each shape spends**, since the three are not interchangeable: the
pairwise different triple spends `hcocycle`, the three with exactly one pair equal spend `hsymm`,
and the all-equal triple spends neither. -/

/-- **The glue data of a cross-member refined cover, with no law left over.**

`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlueData` with its one remaining hypothesis discharged by the theorem
above. What a caller supplies is the original datum's three laws and the two conditions
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumGlueData.lean` adopts — and those two are a hypothesis on the
caller's own choice of `q`, not a law of the refinement:
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumHrange_iff` says they are equivalent to the range law, so they cannot
be weakened and they are not what is left of the cocycle law.

**It is a separate definition and not a replacement.** The general one takes the cocycle law as an
argument and stays useful: a caller who has a refinement whose original datum's `hcocycle` is not
in hand, or who wants the law at a proof of its own, still needs it. -/

`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumAnalytification` at the same arguments. **Nothing here is a witness**:
there is still no example of a refined cover datum at a non-constant `σ` whose two conditions
anything meets, which is taxis #1107's fourth deliverable and is untouched. What has changed is
that a caller who meets them owes nothing further — before this file the object also asked for a
law nothing could prove. -/
