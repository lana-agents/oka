# Presentation-independence of the analytification

`Oka/Analytification/UniversalProperty.lean` proves that for polynomials `g₁, …, g_k` in `n`
variables, morphisms `Z ⟶ X^an` correspond to tuples of `n` global sections of `𝒪_Z` satisfying
the equations, and deduces that `X^an` depends only on the **ideal** the `gⱼ` generate. That is
independence of the *generators*, inside one fixed polynomial ring.

**This file removes the fixed polynomial ring.** A `ℂ`-algebra map `ℂ[y] ⧸ J → ℂ[x] ⧸ I` induces a
morphism of analytifications the other way (`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationMap`), functorially,
**with no relation assumed between the two numbers of variables or the two numbers of equations**.
So two presentations of the same finitely generated `ℂ`-algebra — in different numbers of
variables, with different numbers of relations — have isomorphic analytifications:
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationIsoOfPresHom`.

Together with the universal property this is presentation-independence of the analytification on
objects: `X^an` depends only on the algebra `ℂ[x] ⧸ I`, not on how it was presented.

## How little there is to it, and why that is the surprise

The route one expects — compare two subspaces of two different `ℂ^n`, transport along a change of
coordinates — is not taken and is not needed. **The universal property does all the work**, and
the mechanism is one lemma:

```
ComplexAnalytic.eval₂Hom_transported :
  MvPolynomial.eval₂Hom (analytification g).algebraMap (transported ψ)
    = ((quotientToGlobal g).comp ψ.toRingHom).comp (Ideal.Quotient.mk (presentationIdeal g'))
```

Substituting the *transported* tuple into a polynomial of the target presentation is applying the
`ℂ`-algebra map to its class. Once that is known, `g' j ↦ 0` because `g' j` is in the ideal being
quotiented, so the transported tuple satisfies the target equations and
`ComplexAnalytic.liftHom` produces the morphism. `n` and `n'` never meet.

Both sides of that identity are ring homomorphisms out of `MvPolynomial`, so it is
`MvPolynomial.ringHom_ext` — the same tool as the substitution formula it rests on. On a constant
it is `ComplexAnalytic.quotientToGlobal_mk_C`; on a variable it is `rfl`.

## Functoriality, and what it buys

`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationMap_id` and `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationMap_comp` are proved
from `ComplexAnalytic.hom_ext_analytification` and the naturality of
`ComplexAnalytic.quotientToGlobal` along the induced morphism
(`ComplexAnalytic.Γ_map_analytificationMap_comp_quotientToGlobal`). They are what turn an
isomorphism of presented algebras into an isomorphism of analytifications, which is the point.

## What is still not here

* **A functor.** `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationMap` is contravariant, identity-preserving and
  composition-preserving, so the data of one exists, but nothing here is stated as a
  `CategoryTheory.Functor` and the assignment on objects still takes a *tuple* rather than a
  finitely presented `ℂ`-algebra. That is `Oka/Analytification/Functor.lean`, which bundles
  `ComplexAnalytic.PresHom` as a category and this file's two functoriality lemmas as
  `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFunctor`, and then removes the presentation from the source.
  The presentation is not *constructed* there — the earlier version of this paragraph said it
  would have to be — but chosen, by the inverse of an equivalence of categories.
* **The comparison with `Spec`.** `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpec` is not shown natural in
  the presentation *here*; it is, in `Oka/Analytification/Comparison.lean`, and the ring-level
  square it is `Spec` of is `ComplexAnalytic.Γ_map_analytificationMap_comp_quotientToGlobal`
  below — proved for functoriality rather than for that.
* **Anything analytic.** Every proof here is `MvPolynomial.ringHom_ext` and category-theoretic
  bookkeeping; the analytic content is upstream, in the universal property.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.PresHom`: a `ℂ`-algebra map between two presented algebras, spelled as a ring
  map plus the commutation it must satisfy — **there is no `Algebra ℂ` instance on these
  quotients and none is manufactured.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.PresHom.ofRename`: **a renaming of the variables carrying the target's
  relations into the source's ideal is such a map** — the family of `PresHom`s an explicit
  change of coordinates arrives in, and the only construction here that produces one with
  content in it.
- `ComplexAnalytic.transported`: the tuple of sections of `𝒪_{X^an}` that a `PresHom` names.
- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationMap`: **the induced morphism of analytifications.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationIsoOfPresHom`: **two presentations of one algebra have
  isomorphic analytifications**, with no relation between their numbers of variables.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.eval₂Hom_transported`: substituting the transported tuple is applying the
  `ℂ`-algebra map.
- `ComplexAnalytic.PresHom.ofRename_comp_ofRename`: two renamings inverse to each other give
  mutually inverse `ℂ`-algebra maps, which is what makes such a pair an isomorphism of
  presentations (`ComplexAnalytic.Presentation.isoOfRename`, in
  `Oka/Analytification/Functor.lean`, where presentations have a category).
- `ComplexAnalytic.rename_mem_presentationIdeal`: a renaming carrying the generators of one
  presentation's ideal into another's carries **every element** of it there.
- `ComplexAnalytic.PresHom.ofRename_comp`: **two renamings compose to the renaming of the
  composite** — the general law, of which the inverse-pair statement above is not a case.
- `ComplexAnalytic.Γ_map_analytificationMap_comp_quotientToGlobal`: `quotientToGlobal` is natural
  along the induced morphism.
- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationMap_id` and `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationMap_comp`:
  **functoriality.**

/-! ### `ℂ`-algebra maps from a renaming of the variables

Nothing above produces a `ComplexAnalytic.PresHom` with any content in it: the two constructions
are the identity and composition. This section produces the standard family, a map of *variables*
sending each relation of the target presentation into the ideal of the source one — which is what
a change of coordinates is. `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresHom`, the structure map `A ⟶ A_f`, is
one of these, at `ComplexAnalytic.localisationIncl`. -/

/-- **A renaming of the variables carrying the target's relations into the source's ideal is a
`ℂ`-algebra map of the presented algebras.**

Note the direction, which is the one the rest of the file runs in: the ring map of a
`ComplexAnalytic.PresHom g g'` goes `ℂ[y] ⧸ (g') → ℂ[x] ⧸ (g)`, so `σ` renames the variables of
the *target* presentation `g'` into those of the *source* `g`, and the hypothesis is about
`g' j` and not about `g j`.

The commutation is `MvPolynomial.rename_C`: a renaming fixes the constants, which is exactly
what the field demands. -/

/-- **A renaming that carries each relation of `g'` into the ideal of `g` carries the whole ideal

The hypothesis of `ComplexAnalytic.PresHom.ofRename` is about the generators; this is the same
statement about every element, which is what a *composite* of two such renamings needs — the
middle presentation's ideal is met at an arbitrary element and not at a generator.

`Ideal.span` induction, with the three closure cases discharged by `map_add`, `map_mul` and the
ideal's own closure properties. It is stated here rather than beside
`ComplexAnalytic.presentationIdeal` in `Oka/Analytification/Presentation.lean` because it mentions
two presentations and a rename between them, and that file has neither. -/

/-- **Two renamings compose to the renaming of the composite.**

The general composition law for `ComplexAnalytic.PresHom.ofRename`, which
`ComplexAnalytic.PresHom.ofRename_comp_ofRename` above is *not*: that one assumes `σ ∘ τ = id` and
concludes `ComplexAnalytic.PresHom.id`, so it says nothing about a composite of two renamings that
is not an identity — a tower of presentations, each adjoining variables to the one below, is
exactly that case.

The third hypothesis is what `ComplexAnalytic.rename_mem_presentationIdeal` above supplies, in one
line, from the first two; it is an argument rather than a proof term in the statement so that the
statement reads as a law about `ofRename` and not about a particular way of proving its side
condition. Which proof is supplied is immaterial — `h''` occurs only under `ofRename`, whose value
does not depend on it.

Both sides are ring maps out of a quotient, so the proof is `Ideal.Quotient.ringHom_ext` and then
one element; the variable case of the composite is `MvPolynomial.rename_rename`, which is where the
`σ ∘ τ` on the right-hand side comes from. -/
