# The analytification of a coherent sheaf is coherent

`Oka/Analytification/Sheaf.lean` builds the analytification of a sheaf of modules on
`Spec (ℂ[x] ⧸ I)` and proves it **exact** — right exactness from the adjunction, left exactness
from the flatness of the stalk maps of the comparison morphism. This file draws the conclusion
GAGA consumes: **the analytification of a coherent sheaf is coherent**
(`ComplexAnalytic.isCoherent_analytificationSheaf_of_isCoherent`), through the presented case
(`ComplexAnalytic.isCoherent_analytificationSheaf_cokernel`) which is where the analysis is.

## The coherent statement, and the route it does *not* take

The direct argument does not work and the obstruction is not analytic.
`SheafOfModules.IsCoherent` quantifies over every object of the site and over every morphism
`free L ⟶ M.over X`; downstairs those `L`-indexed families are not in the image of the functor,
so no argument of the form "apply the functor to an upstairs presentation" reaches them.

**The classical route instead gets a presentation out of coherence, and that is what this file
now does.** On `Spec A` the passage is entirely algebraic and happens in
`Oka/AlgebraicGeometry/Modules/Tilde.lean`:

* `SheafOfModules.IsCoherent.isFinitePresentation` — a coherent sheaf is finitely presented on
  *some* covering;
* `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules.finitePresentation_Γ_of_isFinitePresentation` — hence `Γ M` is
  a finitely presented `A`-module, which is the quasi-compactness argument on `Spec A`;
* `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules.exists_isFinite_presentation_of_isCoherent` — hence `M` has a
  finite **global** `SheafOfModules.Presentation`, through `M ≅ (Γ M)^~` and
  `AlgebraicGeometry.presentationTilde`.

**So the local-to-global step happens at the level of modules and never at the level of sheaves**,
which is why no analytic input is needed for it and why the presented statement below is still
the one carrying all of the mathematics.

Note that **finite presentation is not the finite-type argument run again on the relations**: it
is false at quasicoherent-plus-finite-type, for the reason in the module docstring of
`Oka/AlgebraicGeometry/Modules/Tilde.lean`. That is why the middle step above is
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules.finitePresentation_Γ_of_isFinitePresentation`, which carries
`SheafOfModules.IsFinitePresentation` in its hypothesis and in its name, and not
`SheafOfModules.IsFiniteType`.

**That is a statement about which hypothesis suffices, and not about the class being absent.**
`SheafOfModules.IsFiniteType` occurs below and is load-bearing: it is a hypothesis of
`SheafOfModules.IsCoherent.cokernel`, it is supplied by hand inside
`ComplexAnalytic.isCoherent_analytificationSheaf_cokernel`, and
`SheafOfModules.GeneratingSections.IsFiniteType` is what makes the two index types of a
`SheafOfModules.Presentation` finite in the proof of the coherent statement. What it does not do
is reach `Module.FinitePresentation A (Γ M)`, which is the module-level step.

## The coherent statement has no witness in this repository, and that is not a defect of it

`OkaTest/CoherentPresentation.lean` records that **no sheaf on a `Spec` is proved coherent here** —
every coherent sheaf this development exhibits lives on an analytic space. So
`ComplexAnalytic.isCoherent_analytificationSheaf_of_isCoherent` is stated at a hypothesis that is
uninhabited in this tree, and the presented form is the one with a witness. **Do not read the
coherent statement as superseding the presented one**: it is a corollary of it, its hypothesis is
strictly stronger, and until a sheaf on a `Spec` is proved coherent the presented form is what any
consumer here can actually apply.

## The proof, which is three transports and no new mathematics

`SheafOfModules.IsCoherent.cokernel` needs a source of finite type and a **coherent target**;
`SheafOfModules.IsCoherent.free` supplies the target, out of Oka's theorem
(`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoherent_free`), and the analytification of a free sheaf is
free on the same index type (`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationSheafFreeIso`). Right exactness
moves the cokernel across the functor. Nothing is computed.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.isCoherent_analytificationSheaf_cokernel`: **the analytification of the
  cokernel of a morphism of finite free sheaves is coherent.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.isCoherent_analytificationSheaf_of_isCoherent`: **the analytification of a
  coherent sheaf is coherent**, which is the previous statement plus the affine dictionary and
  has no witness here.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isCoherent_analytificationSheaf_cokernel_sectionsHom`: the same for the
  quotient of `𝒪_{Spec A}` by a finitely generated ideal sheaf, which is the shape a subscheme
  of `Spec (ℂ[x] ⧸ I)` arrives in.

## What is *not* here

**GAGA proper.** Agreement of `Hom` and of cohomology across analytification is untouched. The
negative on record — that faithfully flat descent from
`ComplexAnalytic.faithfullyFlat_stalkMap_analytificationToSpec` does not give it, because
`X^an ⟶ Spec A` misses every non-closed point — is *unmeasured*, and should be re-measured
before it is relied on.

/-- **The analytification of the cokernel of a morphism of finite free sheaves is coherent.**

The target `(free K)^an` is free of the same rank, hence coherent by
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoherent_free`, which is Oka's theorem in every finite rank;
the source `(free I)^an` is free, hence of finite type; and the analytification, being a left
adjoint, carries the cokernel to the cokernel. `SheafOfModules.IsCoherent.cokernel` then applies,
and note that it asks only for the *source* to be of finite type — no coherence of `(free I)^an`
is used. -/

/-- **The analytification of a coherent sheaf is coherent.**

The statement GAGA is usually quoted as needing, and it is
`ComplexAnalytic.isCoherent_analytificationSheaf_cokernel` plus the affine dictionary. All of the
analysis is in that theorem — Oka's coherence of `𝒪_X` in every finite rank, and right exactness
of the analytification; **this adds no analysis at all.** What it adds is
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules.exists_isFinite_presentation_of_isCoherent`, which turns
coherence on `Spec A` into a finite *global* presentation, and
`SheafOfModules.Presentation.cokernelIso`, which reads that presentation as a cokernel of finite
free sheaves so the presented theorem applies. See the module docstring for why the
local-to-global step is algebraic.

**This hypothesis is uninhabited in this repository**, and `OkaTest/CoherentPresentation.lean`
says so: nothing here proves a sheaf on a `Spec` coherent. The theorem is not vacuous as
mathematics — it is the standard statement — but it is vacuous *as a check*, so
`ComplexAnalytic.isCoherent_analytificationSheaf_cokernel` remains the form with a witness and the
form to apply.

**The `set_option` is the `Spec R` versus `Spec (CommRingCat.of ↑R)` seam.** The hypothesis
arrives as `M.IsCoherent` at the `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.ringSheaf` spelling of the
base and is consumed at the `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules` spelling; the two are definitionally
equal — that equality is `rfl`, measured — but instance search does not cross it without the
option. Measured by deleting it; no explanation is offered. -/
