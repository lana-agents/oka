# The analytification as a functor

`Oka/Analytification/ChangeOfVariables.lean` proves that a `ℂ`-algebra map between two presented
algebras induces a morphism of analytifications, that identities go to identities and composites
to composites. That is the *data* of a functor. This file bundles it as one, and then removes the
presentation from the source.

The two steps are different in kind. Bundling is bookkeeping: a `Category` instance on
presentations whose three laws are `ComplexAnalytic.PresHom.ext` applied to the corresponding
`RingHom` laws. Removing the presentation is the step every previous account of this development
described as *"choosing a presentation for each algebra, which is a construction this file does
not perform"* — and the point of this file is that **it is not a construction and should not be
one.**

## Do not choose a presentation

`ComplexAnalytic.toFGAlg`, sending a presentation to the algebra it presents, is **fully
faithful** — a `ComplexAnalytic.PresHom` *is* a `ℂ`-algebra map of the presented algebras, with
both round trips `rfl` — and **essentially surjective** onto the finitely generated `ℂ`-algebras,
which is `ComplexAnalytic.exists_presentation`. So it is an equivalence, and
`CategoryTheory.Functor.asEquivalence` supplies the inverse. The presentation attached to an
algebra is then whatever `Classical.choice` picks out of essential surjectivity, and nothing
depends on which one it is, because any two are related by the equivalence.

The only mathematical content in essential surjectivity is **Hilbert's basis theorem**: a
finitely *generated* `ℂ`-algebra is a quotient of a polynomial ring in finitely many variables,
and the kernel is finitely generated because that polynomial ring is Noetherian. That is why
"finitely generated" and "finitely presented" are the same condition here, and it is the whole
reason a presentation exists to be chosen.

## The price of the choice, and why the comparison isomorphism is not optional

`analytificationFGAlg.obj (op A)` is **not** definitionally `AnalyticSpace.analytification g` for
a presentation `g` of `A`; it is the analytification of whichever presentation choice produced.
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFGAlgCompIso` is what connects the two, and without it the
functor would be a definition nothing can be computed from.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.Presentation`: a finite presentation `(n, k, g)`, bundled so that it can be the
  object of a category. Morphisms are `ComplexAnalytic.PresHom`, which run in the direction of the
  induced morphisms of spaces, so this category is the *opposite* of the category of presented
  algebras.
- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFunctor : Presentation ⥤ AnalyticSpace`: **the analytification,
  as a functor on presentations.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.Presentation.isoOfRename`: **a pair of mutually inverse renamings of the
  variables is an isomorphism of presentations**, and so, through the functor, an isomorphism of
  analytifications.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isFiniteType`: finite type, as a property of an object of `CommAlgCat ℂ`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.Presentation.isoOfAlgEquiv`: **an isomorphism of the presented algebras is
  an isomorphism of presentations** — the general companion of
  `ComplexAnalytic.Presentation.isoOfRename`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.Presentation.algEquivOfIso`: **and back again**, which is what a consumer
  holding an isomorphism of presentations needs before it can reach any statement phrased about
  algebras, with `ComplexAnalytic.Presentation.isoOfAlgEquiv_algEquivOfIso` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.Presentation.algEquivOfIso_isoOfAlgEquiv` saying that the two are mutually
  inverse — the first is the composite that consumer meets.
- `ComplexAnalytic.toFGAlg : Presentation ⥤ (isFiniteType.FullSubcategory)ᵒᵖ`: a presentation,
  read as the finitely generated `ℂ`-algebra it presents.
- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFGAlg`: **the analytification of a finitely generated
  `ℂ`-algebra, as a functor**, with no presentation in its statement.
- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFGAlgCompIso`, `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFGAlgObjIso`: the
  comparison with the presentation-level construction.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.toFGAlgFullyFaithful`: a `ℂ`-algebra map of presented algebras is the same
  thing as a morphism of presentations.
- `ComplexAnalytic.exists_presentation`: **every finitely generated `ℂ`-algebra is a presented
  algebra.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.instIsEquivalenceToFGAlg`: presentations *are* finitely generated
  `ℂ`-algebras.
- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFGAlgObjIso_hom`: the comparison isomorphism is the functor
  applied to the inverse of the unit — the only content in it, and what lets a consumer compose
  with it.

## What is not here

* **Naturality of the comparison with `Spec`** is not here, and is no longer missing: it is
  `Oka/Analytification/Comparison.lean`, which makes `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpec` a
  natural transformation on presentations and then, along the equivalence below, one on the
  finitely generated `ℂ`-algebras themselves. That is what makes `X^an ⟶ X` part of the
  structure rather than a separate construction per presentation. It stays in a separate file
  because this one is about the *source* category and that one is about the target.
* **Anything non-affine.** A functor on schemes locally of finite type would be built from this
  one by gluing, and nothing here glues.
* **Anything analytic.** Every proof in this file is category-theoretic bookkeeping or
  commutative algebra; the analytic content is upstream, in the universal property.

## Design notes

**Why the full subcategory of `CommAlgCat ℂ` and not `AlgCat ℂ`, `Under (CommRingCat.of ℂ)` or
`Scheme`.** The analytification is defined only for commutative algebras, so `CommAlgCat` rather
than `AlgCat`; and `Algebra.FiniteType` is *exactly* the essential image of `Presentation` by
`ComplexAnalytic.exists_presentation`, so cutting the category down to it is not an arbitrary
restriction but the precise statement of what the construction covers. Affine schemes are one
`Spec` away and are a separate step, not a different foundation.

**Why a bespoke `Presentation` rather than a general presentation type.** `ComplexAnalytic.PresHom`
and `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationMap` are stated for a tuple
`g : Fin k → MvPolynomial (ULift (Fin n)) ℂ`; this structure is that tuple with its two indices,
and nothing more. It exists so that `PresHom` has a category to live in.

**And it is not the subject of `Oka/Analytification/Presentation.lean`.**
`ComplexAnalytic.Presentation` here is the bundled triple `(n, k, g)` that gives
`ComplexAnalytic.PresHom` a category to live in; `Oka/Analytification/Presentation.lean` is a
different thing — the construction of `X^an` from one such tuple, which this file's objects
index.

Those run in the direction of the induced morphisms of analytic spaces rather than of the
underlying `ℂ`-algebra maps, so this is the *opposite* of the category of presented algebras —
which is why `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFunctor` below is covariant and
`ComplexAnalytic.toFGAlg` lands in an opposite category.

All three laws are `ComplexAnalytic.PresHom.ext` applied to the corresponding `RingHom` law: the
commutation with the structure map is a proposition, so a morphism is its ring map. -/

/-- **The analytification, as a functor on presentations.**

/-- **The functor's value is the analytification**, by `rfl`.

Stated because it is not `rfl` to `simp`: `Category.id_comp` will not fire on
`𝟙 (analytificationFunctor.obj P) ≫ f` when `f`'s domain is spelled
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.analytification P.g`, which is how every consumer of the functor
spells it.

Three proofs in `Oka/Analytification/CoverFunctoriality.lean` need it, and erasing the attribute
there leaves exactly those three failing and nothing else:
`ComplexAnalytic.comm_coverMapPart_id`, `ComplexAnalytic.comm_coverMapPart_comp` and
`ComplexAnalytic.coverMap_comp`. `ComplexAnalytic.coverMap_id` is not among them — it needs this
only through the first. -/

/-- **A pair of mutually inverse renamings of the variables, each carrying the other
presentation's relations into this one's ideal, is an isomorphism of presentations.**

`ComplexAnalytic.PresHom.ofRename` twice, with
`ComplexAnalytic.PresHom.ofRename_comp_ofRename` for both triangles. It is stated here rather
than beside those, because an isomorphism needs the `Category` instance above and that instance
is what this file exists to give.

Mind the direction. A morphism `P ⟶ Q` is a `ComplexAnalytic.PresHom P.g Q.g`, whose ring map
runs `Q.alg → P.alg`, so the renaming `σ` underlying `hom` sends the variables of `Q` to those
of `P`. The two hypotheses `hστ` and `hτσ` are equalities of maps of *variables*, not of
polynomials — which is why an isomorphism of presented algebras of this shape costs no
commutative algebra at all.

Applying `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFunctor` to the result is how a change of coordinates
becomes an isomorphism of analytic spaces; `OkaTest/ProjectiveLine.lean` glues `ℙ¹` out of two
copies of `𝔸¹` along one of them. -/

/-- **A `ℂ`-algebra isomorphism of the presented algebras is an isomorphism of presentations.**

The general companion of `ComplexAnalytic.Presentation.isoOfRename`, which is the special case
where the map comes from a renaming of the variables and costs no commutative algebra. This one
takes the algebra isomorphism as given, which is the shape it arrives in when it comes from
outside — from a scheme, say, whose two affine members agree on an overlap.

It is `ComplexAnalytic.toFGAlgFullyFaithful.preimageIso` in content, and is stated directly
because assembling the isomorphism in the opposite full subcategory that lemma consumes is longer
than the four lines here. Mind the direction, as in `ComplexAnalytic.Presentation.isoOfRename`:
the algebra map of `P ⟶ Q` runs `Q.alg → P.alg`. -/

/-- **An isomorphism of presentations is a `ℂ`-algebra isomorphism of the presented algebras**,
the inverse of `ComplexAnalytic.Presentation.isoOfAlgEquiv`.

Both directions of the algebra map are already there — a `ComplexAnalytic.PresHom` *is* a ring map
and its `commutes` field is the `ℂ`-linearity — so the four fields below are the two triangles of
the isomorphism read at a point. It is stated because a consumer who holds an isomorphism of
presentations, rather than of algebras, could otherwise reach nothing that is phrased about
algebras: `ComplexAnalytic.Presentation.isoOfAlgEquiv` went one way only until this was written.

Mind the direction, which is that of `ComplexAnalytic.PresHom` itself: the algebra map of
`P ⟶ Q` runs `Q.alg → P.alg`, so an isomorphism `P ≅ Q` gives `Q.alg ≃ₐ[ℂ] P.alg` and not the
other way about. -/

/-- **The round trip through the algebras is the identity**, which is the half of *"the inverse
of"* that a consumer travels.

A consumer holding `φ : P ≅ Q` — the shape a cover datum's glue field is in — and wanting a
statement phrased about algebras passes to `ComplexAnalytic.Presentation.algEquivOfIso`, and the
statement hands back an isomorphism of presentations built with
`ComplexAnalytic.Presentation.isoOfAlgEquiv`. Without this they land on
`ComplexAnalytic.Presentation.isoOfAlgEquiv (ComplexAnalytic.Presentation.algEquivOfIso φ)` where
they wanted `φ`, with nothing to close the gap:
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentationIsoOfAlgEquiv_hom_comp` is exactly such a consumer, since
its right-hand factor is an `isoOfAlgEquiv`.

It is `rfl` because both constructions only repackage the two ring maps already present, and an
`Iso` is its two morphisms and two proofs; no field is computed on either side. -/

directions rather than a name.

`ComplexAnalytic.Presentation.isoOfAlgEquiv_algEquivOfIso` is. This direction is on no consumer
