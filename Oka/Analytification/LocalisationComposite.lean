# Localising a presentation twice is localising it once, at the product

`ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentation g f` adjoins a variable `t` and the equation `t·f - 1`.
Doing that twice — first at `f`, then at a polynomial `f₁` in the *old* variables, renamed along
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationIncl` — adjoins two variables and two equations. This file says the
result is the single localisation at `f₁ * f`.

* `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentedAlgebraEquivMul` — **the two presented algebras are
  isomorphic**, as `ℂ`-algebras.
* `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentedAlgebraEquivMul_localisationRingHom` — **and the
  isomorphism is one of `A`-algebras**: it carries the composite of the two structure maps to the
  single structure map `A ⟶ A_{f₁·f}`. This is the half with content; the isomorphism alone would
  leave the composite unrelated to what it is a composite of.
* `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentationIsoMul` — the same as an isomorphism of objects of
  `ComplexAnalytic.Presentation`, which is the form a coherence law consumes, and hence an
  isomorphism of analytic spaces through `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFunctor`.

## Where this is needed

Taxis #1006, split from #996. `Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Sites/SmallAffineZariski.lean` indexes
the affine members of a scheme by *"is a distinguished open of"*, and the witness for a composite
arrow `U ≤ V ≤ W` is manufactured by `IsAffineOpen.basicOpen_basicOpen_is_basicOpen` — a third
section, neither of the two it is composed from. A transition morphism per arrow therefore has to
know that localising twice is localising once, and `trans_comp` is exactly that statement. The
polynomial version of that manufactured witness is the product, and this file is it.

Together with `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentationIsoOfDvdPow`, which says the presentation
does not depend on which polynomial cuts the open out, that is both halves of what a witness-built
transition needs. Neither is the transition, and neither mentions
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme`.

## The statement is `IsLocalization.Away.mul`, and the work is the transport

`IsLocalization.Away.mul` in `Mathlib/RingTheory/Localization/Away/Basic.lean` — with the two
instances beneath it for `Localization.Away` — already says that localising `R` at `x` and then at
the image of `y` is localising `R` at `y * x`. **Nothing about the composite is proved here.** What
is proved is that this development's presented algebras are those localisations, compatibly with
their structure maps.

That transport is not free, because of a deliberate absence recorded in
`Oka/Analytification/DistinguishedOpen.lean`, in the docstring of
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentedAlgebraEquiv`: there is **no**
`Algebra (ComplexAnalytic.PresentedAlgebra n k g)` instance on the localised presented algebra,
and so `IsLocalization.Away.mul` cannot be applied to it. Three shapes were available:

1. add that instance, and apply `IsLocalization.Away.mul` directly;
2. add it as a `local instance`, in this file only;
3. **do the algebra where the instances already exist — on `Localization.Away` — and move the
   conclusion across `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentedAlgebraEquiv` by hand.**

**Shape 3, and the reason is not a preference between them.** An `Algebra` instance keyed on
`ComplexAnalytic.PresentedAlgebra` is an instance on the type this development uses everywhere,
so typeclass search would meet it on every unrelated goal; that is the cost the quoted paragraph
declines to pay, and paying it here would falsify that paragraph one file away. Shape 2 answers
the objection but not the arithmetic: `IsLocalization.Away.mul`'s own instance arguments are
resolved by search, so a `local instance` buys nothing that the explicit route below does not, at
the price of a second `Algebra` structure on a type that already has one over `ℂ`. Shape 3 needs
one extra step — `ComplexAnalytic.localisationAwayRingEquiv` — and introduces no instance at all.

The step that makes shape 3 short is
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentedAlgebraEquiv_localisationRingHom`, which says the
identification with `Localization.Away` is over `A`. Without it the two structure maps are
unrelated and the transport has nothing to be compatible with.

## What is not here

**No cover, no transition morphism, and no `trans_comp`.** Taxis #996 keeps those. This file
supplies the algebra a transition would be built from and stops there; nothing below mentions
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme` or `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData`, and no Mathlib import is added —
`IsLocalization.Away.mul` arrives with `Oka/RingTheory/Localization/Away/Basic.lean`, which this
file's import already carries.

**No second polynomial in the new variable.** `f₁` is renamed along
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationIncl`, so it comes from the old variables. That is not a convenience:
localising at a polynomial that mentions `t` is not a localisation of `A` at all, so the composite
would not be one either and there would be no product to compare it with.

/-! ### The localisation of `A_f` at `f₁`, transported to `Localization.Away` -/

/-- **The two ways of localising `A_f` at `f₁` agree**, as rings: on the left `f₁` is read in the
presented algebra `A_f`, as the class of its renaming — which is
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationRingHom` applied to the class of `f₁`, by
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationRingHom_mk` — and on the right in `Localization.Away`, through its
`algebraMap`. The renamed spelling is the one used throughout, because it is what
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentedAlgebraEquiv` produces at the localised presentation.

This is `IsLocalization.ringEquivOfRingEquiv` along
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentedAlgebraEquiv`; the hypothesis it wants — that the
isomorphism carries one powers-submonoid to the other — is
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentedAlgebraEquiv_localisationRingHom` under
`Submonoid.map_powers`, and it is the whole reason that lemma is stated over `A`. -/

The left-hand side adjoins `t` with `t·f - 1` and then `s` with `s·f₁ - 1`; the right-hand side
adjoins one variable with `t·(f₁·f) - 1`. The four steps are: identify each side with a
`Localization.Away` by `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentedAlgebraEquiv`, cross the two readings
of `f₁` by `ComplexAnalytic.localisationAwayAlgEquiv`, and use that a localisation of a
localisation is a localisation at the product — `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalization_away_mul` — so
that `IsLocalization.algEquiv` identifies it with the localisation at `f₁·f`. -/

two algebras are abstractly isomorphic. Each of the four steps is compatible with the structure
maps for its own reason: the two outer ones by
