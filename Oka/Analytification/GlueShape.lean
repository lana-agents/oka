# The two-level index category of a glue data, and the four things a cover still has to supply

`OkaTest/LocalisationRigidity.lean` ends by naming the gap between an ordered family of
presentations and `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData`, and its `## What is not here` says what a
reader should know before attempting it:

> a glue data's own diagram has **two levels of object** — members `U i` and overlaps `V (i, j)` —
> and its law is a cocycle on triple overlaps expressed with pullbacks. That is a different law on
> a different index shape from the `trans_comp` a chain exercises, so choosing witnesses does not
> turn one into the other and `hcocycle` should be expected **not** to follow.

This file builds that two-level shape and settles, one at a time, which of
`ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData`'s five inputs a functor out of it produces. Two of them are the
diagram's own data, one is a consequence of its single law, and the other two are not implied —
the last of those is a theorem here and not a prediction.

## The shape

`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.Shape J` has an object `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.mem i` for each member
and an object `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.ovl i j` for each **ordered** pair, generating arrows
`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.incl i j : ovl i j ⟶ mem i` and
`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.swap i j : ovl i j ⟶ ovl j i`, and one relation,
`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.swap_swap`. It is the free category on that quiver modulo that relation:
`CategoryTheory.Paths` and `CategoryTheory.Quotient`, two `import` lines.

**The move under `Oka/` made this file cheaper rather than dearer, and the figure is the argument
for the import it now carries.** At `OkaTest/GlueShape.lean` it imported
`OkaTest/LocalisationRigidity.lean`, which reaches `Oka` whole through
`OkaTest/LocalisationChain.lean`; it now imports `Oka/Analytification/AffineCover.lean`, which is
all it ever used. Transitive closure of the import list, from `env.header.moduleNames` under `lake
env lean` and not from a source parser: **3642 → 3381** counting `Oka` + `OkaTest` + `Mathlib`, of
which `Oka` **150 → 78**, `OkaTest` **2 → 0** and `Mathlib` **3490 → 3303**; all modules including
`Lean` and `Batteries`, 5392 → 5131. The two `CategoryTheory` imports are free against that
baseline and were free against the old one.

**The before-column is the tree this file left, and re-measuring it here gives one more.** The old
import list reaches `Oka` whole — that is the point of the paragraph — so once `Oka.lean` names
this module, measuring the *old* list on *this* tree closes over the moved file itself and returns
`Oka` 151, sum 3643, all 5393. The figures above are the ones a reader wants, which is what the
move cost, and they are checkable without a build: the `Oka.*` count is `Oka.lean`'s import lines
plus one for `Oka` itself, 149 + 1 there against 150 + 1 here.

Their cost is not zero everywhere, and the other figure is what a `Oka/CategoryTheory/` home would
be priced at: `scripts/import_cost.py --target Mathlib.CategoryTheory.GlueData` puts them at **2**
against `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/GlueData.lean`'s closure of 540. **That script cannot price this
file where it now sits** — it answers the mirror-tree question, and `Oka/Analytification/` has no
`Mathlib/Analytification/` to be a mirror of, so it reports the path as one that *"does not exist
in Mathlib"* rather than a cost. See `## What is not here`.

**Going through the path category is what keeps `CategoryTheory.eqToHom` out of the shape and its
`lift` API, and that was the predicted expense.** Everything from `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.Obj` to
`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.symm_eq_of_hom_comp_hom` is free of `eqToHom`, `CategoryTheory.eqToIso`,
`▸` and `cast`; the counterexample at the end of the file transports, at
`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.ctGlue`, and there is nothing wrong with that. Writing the hom-types by
hand instead runs into the diagonal: `ovl i i ⟶ mem i` has to have two elements, `incl i i` and
`swap i i ≫ incl i i`, and the obvious hand-written hom-type — a sum of two propositions saying
`l = i` and `l = j` — has two elements when `i ≠ j` and *also* two when `i = j`, but a functor out
of it then has to produce a morphism from a proof of `l = i ∨ l = j`, which is data from a `Prop`.
The quotient of the path category has neither problem and the whole construction is under a hundred
lines.

**The shape is deliberately not thin.** `swap i i` is not forced to be the identity: the only
relation is that the two transitions of an overlap are inverse. Imposing `swap i i = 𝟙` would
exclude the inputs `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData` accepts, whose diagonal is filled in by
`CategoryTheory.GlueData.ofGlueData'` and not by the cover — see the `## What is not here`.

## What a cover has to supply, item by item

`ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData` takes `obj`, `poly`, `glue`, `hrange`, `hsymm` and `hcocycle`.
Against the diagram:

| input | where it comes from |
|---|---|
| `obj` | the diagram at the members, `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.coverDiagram_obj_mem` |
| `poly` | the diagram at the overlaps, `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.coverDiagram_obj_ovl` |
| `glue` | the diagram at the transitions, `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.coverDiagram_map_swap` |
| `hsymm` | **follows**, `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.hsymm_of_hglue` |
| `hrange` | **does not follow**, `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.not_ctHRange` |
| `hcocycle` | not stateable without `hrange`; see below |

`hsymm` is the one that changes the interface, and it is a change of **form and not of count**:
`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.coverGlueDataOfDiagram` and `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData` take the same
six explicit arguments, with `hglue` in the place of `hsymm` rather than in addition to nothing.
`coverGlueData` asks for `glue j i = (glue i j).symm`, an equation of *isomorphisms*; the shape asks
only that the two transitions compose to the identity, an equation of *morphisms*. Those are the
same condition — a right inverse of an isomorphism is its inverse,
`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.symm_eq_of_hom_comp_hom` — but only the second is the form functoriality
hands you (`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.map_swap_comp`). Anyone who already has a functor out of
`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.Shape` has `hglue` for free; nobody has `hsymm` for free. It would become
a change of count if `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.coverGlueDataOfDiagram` took the functor rather than
its four components, which is not done here.

`hcocycle` is a different case from `hrange` and the difference is worth stating precisely: it is
not that it fails to follow, it is that **it cannot be written down without `hrange`**. Its
statement is an equation between composites of `ComplexAnalytic.coverTriple`, and `hrange` is an
argument of `ComplexAnalytic.coverTriple`. So the question *"does `hcocycle` follow from the
diagram?"* has no formulation until `hrange` is granted, which is a stronger statement than the
one `OkaTest/LocalisationRigidity.lean` predicted.

## `hrange` really does not follow, and three members is where it is visible

`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.not_ctHRange` exhibits a three-member cover — every member the
presentation of a point, `ULift (Fin 0)` variables and no relations — with a witness polynomial for
every ordered pair and an isomorphism for every pair satisfying the shape's law, whose range
hypothesis is **false**. The configuration is `poly i j = 1` unless neither index is `0`, where it
is `0`; then `D(1) = ⊤` makes the triple overlap inside the zeroth member the whole space, and
`D(0) = ⊥` makes the open it is required to land in empty. The zeroth member has a point, so the
range is not empty and the containment fails.

Three is also the smallest index type that can see it, in both hypotheses:
`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.hRange_of_no_three` and `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.hCocycle_of_no_three`
say that both are automatic on any index type with no three pairwise distinct elements.
`OkaTest/ProjectiveLine.lean` records the two-member vacuity for **both** — at
`ComplexAnalytic.hrange_lineCover` and `ComplexAnalytic.hcocycle_lineCover`, each proved from
`ComplexAnalytic.pair_no_distinct_triple`, whose own docstring says `ℙ¹` needs *"neither a range
condition nor a cocycle"*. What the two theorems here add is the form that quantifies over the index
type rather than over one gluing, so that "test at three" is a statement about the index type and
not about that one cover.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.Shape`: the two-level index category of a glue data.
- `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.lift`: a functor out of it, from members, overlaps, inclusions and
  transitions with the one law.
- `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.coverDiagram`: the diagram of a cover with distinguished overlaps, as a
  functor to `ComplexAnalytic.Presentation`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.HRange` and `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.HCocycle`: the two
  triple-overlap hypotheses of `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData`, named so that they can be talked
  about.
- `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.coverGlueDataOfDiagram`: the glue data of a cover, out of its diagram
  and those two hypotheses and nothing else.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.lift_uniq`: **every functor out of the shape is the one its own data
  produces**, so the shape has no morphisms beyond those a glue-data diagram accounts for.
- `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.hsymm_of_hglue`: **the symmetry hypothesis is a consequence of the
  shape's law** and not an independent input.
- `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.not_ctHRange`: **the range hypothesis is not a consequence of the
  diagram.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.hRange_of_no_three` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.hCocycle_of_no_three`: neither triple-overlap hypothesis has content
  below three members.

## What is not here

**No `poly`, `glue`, `hrange` or `hcocycle` for an *ordered* cover.** The question
`OkaTest/LocalisationRigidity.lean` asks is what an ordered family of presentations may be assumed
to look like; this file answers a different one — what shape a glue data's diagram has — and the
two are related only in that the second is where the first was heading. Nothing here produces a
witness polynomial from an arrow of a preorder, and `OkaTest.LocalisationRigidity.ofPreorder` is
untouched.

**No two-level shape with the diagonal collapsed.** `CategoryTheory.GlueData` asks for `t i i =
𝟙` and `CategoryTheory.GlueData'` does not have `V (i, i)` at all;
`CategoryTheory.GlueData.ofGlueData'` is the bridge, and it fills the diagonal with `U i` behind a
`dif` on `i = j`. The shape here has the diagonal and does not collapse it, which is what makes
`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.coverDiagram` accept exactly the input `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData`
accepts. A variant shape with `swap i i = 𝟙` imposed would be a different category and is not built.

**Nothing about `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace`.** The diagram lands in
`ComplexAnalytic.Presentation`; every statement about the glued space is
`ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData`'s and is reached only through
`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.coverGlueDataOfDiagram`. In particular there is no claim here that the
glued space is anything, and no non-vacuity: `OkaTest/AffineCover.lean` and
`OkaTest/ProjectiveLine.lean` remain the two instances that check that.

**No split between the shape and the cover, and the case for one is measured rather than
dismissed.** This file has two halves. Everything from `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.Obj` to
`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.symm_eq_of_hom_comp_hom` is category theory in an arbitrary `C` and
mentions nothing analytic; its two imports alone close at **356** Mathlib modules, and it is the
half that would be a mirror-tree candidate beside `Oka/CategoryTheory/GlueData.lean`, where
`scripts/import_cost.py` prices it at 2. Everything from `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.coverDiagram`
onwards needs `ComplexAnalytic.Presentation`, `ComplexAnalytic.coverSpace` and
`ComplexAnalytic.coverOpen`, so it cannot go there at all: an `Oka.Analytification.AffineCover`
import inside `Oka/CategoryTheory/` inverts the hierarchy. **So the destination question is not a
choice between two homes; it is whether this is one file.** It is left as one because splitting it
is a design change and this arrival was a move; nothing below depends on the answer.

**Nothing here is a mirror file.** `README.md`'s mirror-tree rule is about a path under `Oka/`
that names a Mathlib target, and this path does not, so no upstreaming cost is stated and
`scripts/import_cost.py` has nothing to say about it. The figure in `## The shape` is a transitive
closure inside this repository, which is a different question with a different baseline.

**No claim that this file is still where it started, and the convention that put it under
`OkaTest/` is spent rather than restated.** `OkaTest/LocalisationRigidity.lean` states it —
category theory with no analytic content stays in a test file until something consumes it, and
`Oka/Analytification/` is its home when something does. `ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification` is
what consumes `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData`, so the condition is met and this file moved; the
bullet that used to stand here promised the move and is gone rather than left promising it.

rules out every arrow of a *chain* being a one-step localisation at once; this shape has no chain

Together with the four computation lemmas above this says the shape is exactly right: a functor out

`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.lift` would only be a way of building some functors, and the claim that
the shape is the index category of a glue data would be a description rather than a theorem.

That dependence is the answer to *"does the cocycle condition follow from the diagram?"*, and it

hypothesis is granted, because `ComplexAnalytic.coverTriple` — the morphism the three composites
are built from — is defined only in its presence. -/

`ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData` with `hglue` in the place of `hsymm` — the same six explicit
arguments, and what the shape buys at this stage is the *form* of that one: `hglue` is an equation
of morphisms, which functoriality gives (`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.map_swap_comp`), where `hsymm`
is an equation of isomorphisms, which it does not. `obj`, `poly` and `glue` are the diagram's own
data, `hsymm` is `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.hsymm_of_hglue`, and what is left over is exactly the
two conditions that are about triple overlaps in `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace` rather than
about the diagram. -/

over the index type rather than over one gluing — the same relation
`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.hCocycle_of_no_three` bears to the cocycle one. That file proves both
there, at `ComplexAnalytic.hrange_lineCover` and `ComplexAnalytic.hcocycle_lineCover`, from
`ComplexAnalytic.pair_no_distinct_triple`; what is added here is that it is a statement about the
index type, so a two-member instance is not evidence about `hrange` any more than about `hcocycle`.

/-! ### A three-member cover whose diagram is good and whose range hypothesis is false

Every member is the presentation of a point — no variables and no relations — so the analytic
side is as small as it can be and the only thing that varies is the witness polynomial. The
configuration is symmetric, so the transition isomorphisms are transports along an equality and
the shape's law holds; and it is chosen so that in `hrange 0 1 2` the source open is everything
and the target open is empty.

/-- **The range hypothesis is not a consequence of the diagram.**

`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.ctObj`, `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.ctPoly` and
`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.ctGlue` are a three-member cover with a witness for every ordered pair
and an isomorphism for every pair satisfying the shape's one law —
`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.ctHglue` — and the range hypothesis fails at the triple `(0, 1, 2)`. Both
witnesses out of the zeroth member are `1`, so the triple overlap there is the whole space and
`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.ctPt` is a point of it; the witness from the first member to the second
is `0`, so the open the image is required to lie in is empty.

This is what `OkaTest/LocalisationRigidity.lean` predicted for the cocycle condition, established
one hypothesis earlier and as a theorem rather than an expectation. It also fixes the smallest
index type at which the failure is visible: three, by
`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.hRange_of_no_three`. -/
