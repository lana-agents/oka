# A cover datum's diagonal is unread, and the space it glues to says so

`Oka/Analytification/AffineCover.lean`'s `## The diagonal` section records that the diagonal data
of a cover datum — `poly i i` and `glue i i` — is asked for and never consumed, and that
`poly i i = 1` with `glue i i = Iso.refl` *"is the natural choice, satisfies it, and is checked by
nothing"*. `Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberDatum.lean` then **uses** that: its
`ComplexAnalytic.polyDiagOne` normalises the diagonal to `1` so that one product serves the two
cases of a cross-member refined `poly`, and until this file existed it gave the half it could not
prove a section of its own:

> **What is not proved here is that normalising leaves the glued space unchanged.** It is a
> statement about `ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification` of two data that differ on the diagonal,
> nothing below states it, and the paragraph above is an argument and not a citation of one.

**That sentence is no longer in that file.** The same branch that added this one replaced it with
a citation of what is below, so the quotation is of what stood there until 2026-08-31 and is here
to say what this file is for and not to describe the file as it is now.

This file is that statement, and it comes out stronger than the diagonal:
`ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification_congr` says the glued analytic space depends on `poly` and
`glue` **only through their values off the diagonal**, for any two data that agree there.
`ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification_polyDiagOne` is the instance
`Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberDatum.lean` asks for.

## Why the two data are not two values of one type, which is the whole cost

`glue i j` is an isomorphism of `ComplexAnalytic.coverOverlap obj poly i j` with
`ComplexAnalytic.coverOverlap obj poly j i`, so `poly i i` occurs in the **type** of `glue`. Two
data differing on the diagonal therefore have `glue`s of different types, their overlaps
`ComplexAnalytic.coverPart` are equal only propositionally, and every field below inherits that:
`f`'s type mentions `V`, `t`'s mentions `V` twice. So the comparison is `HEq` from `f` down and
there is no `Eq` anywhere to `rw` with. **That, and not the geometry, is what this file costs.**

Each transport is the same two lines — abstract the polynomial (or the open, or the morphism) as a
*variable*, `rintro … rfl`, and the two sides become one — and they are named rather than inlined
because the next author to compare two cover data will want them and they are not discoverable
from the goal.

## `t'` is not among them, and that is a fact about `CategoryTheory.GlueData'`

The field that would have been worst is `t'`, whose type mentions four pullbacks of the `f`s.
`CategoryTheory.GlueData'.ext_of_heq` does not ask for it: `t_fac` factorises `t'` through
`CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback.snd`, which is a pullback of the monomorphism `f j k`, so `t'` is
determined by `t` and `CategoryTheory.cancel_mono` supplies it. That lemma is in
`Oka/CategoryTheory/GlueData.lean` because it is about Mathlib's structure and not about a cover.

## One place where the elaborator has to be told the type, and one where it was thought to be

* **`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofGlueDataCLinear_congr`'s `HEq` argument.** The two
  `ℂ`-algebra families here are the *same expression* — the members' own algebra maps — but their
  types read `(D.U i).presheaf.obj (op ⊤)` at two different glue data. Passing `HEq.rfl` against an
  inferred type exceeds the default heartbeat budget; a `have` at the spelled-out family is
  immediate, and the difference is that the second never asks the elaborator to reduce
  `CategoryTheory.GlueData.ofGlueData'` inside a metavariable. **The failure is machine-dependent
  and the workaround is not**: measured three times on 2026-08-31, the inline form gives
  `(kernel) deterministic timeout` after 2m32s and after 154s on two machines and is killed after
  150s on a third, where the hoisted form costs about a minute for the whole file. The `have hα`
  inside `ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification_congr` is that, and it is not style.

  **It is a cost and not a non-termination**, and until 2026-08-31 the first sentence above said
  *"does not elaborate at all"*, which is stronger than any of those three runs shows. Under
  `set_option maxHeartbeats 0` this module **builds** with the inline form, in 489s against 60s as
  shipped — so what the `have` buys is about eight times the file. `lakefile.toml` sets no
  `maxHeartbeats`, so the budget all three failures met is Lean's default 200000, and the figure
  of a million that `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Glue.lean` gave for the same seam named a budget nobody
  set. See that file for the same correction from the other side.
* **`ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification_polyDiagOne` needs no such thing, and this section said
  it did.** Until 2026-08-31 the bullet here read *"with the six `Prop` arguments left to
  unification the application times out, and with all of `poly`, `poly'`, `glue`, `glue'` and the
  six named it is immediate"*. It does not: deleting **every** named argument from that proof,
  leaving `coverAnalytification_congr` applied to its two explicit hypotheses, builds the module
  under `lake build --wfail` in 55s against 61s with them, which is noise. The named arguments
  have gone with the claim. The timeout is real one level up — it is the bullet above — and
  fixing it there is what made this workaround unnecessary; nothing re-tested it until the branch
  was reviewed. **A measured claim that no longer reproduces is worse than no claim**, which is
  why the retraction is here rather than a silent deletion.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.glueDiagOne`: **a cover datum's `glue` carried to its diagonal-normalised
  form.** Off the diagonal it is a `cast` of the original — `cast` rather than a conjugation by
  `CategoryTheory.eqToIso`, because `cast_heq` is then the whole of
  `ComplexAnalytic.heq_glueDiagOne` — and on the diagonal it is `CategoryTheory.eqToIso`, which
  nothing below reads.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData'_congr`, `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData_congr` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification_congr`: **two cover data that agree off the diagonal have
  the same glue datum, and glue to the same analytic space.** The hypotheses are exactly
  `poly i j = poly' i j` and `HEq (glue i j) (glue' i j)` at `i ≠ j`; nothing is asked at `i = i`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.hrange_congr` and `ComplexAnalytic.hcocycle_congr`: **the two geometric
  hypotheses transport**, so the second datum is a datum whenever the first is. Both are stated
  only at distinct indices, which is why they transport at all.
- `ComplexAnalytic.hsymm_glueDiagOne`: and so does the symmetry hypothesis, including at the
  diagonal, where `CategoryTheory.eqToIso` of a proof of `X = X` is its own inverse.
- `ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification_polyDiagOne`: **a cover datum and its diagonal-normalised
  form glue to the same analytic space**, with the normalised datum's three hypotheses supplied
  rather than assumed. This is the statement `Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberDatum.lean` names as
  what a consumer of `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumPoly` will need.

## What is not here

* **No claim that `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumPoly`'s correctness depends on this.** It does not,
  as far as anything compiled says: a refined datum's overlaps are built from
  `ComplexAnalytic.polyDiagOne` directly, and `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumPoly_of_eq` lands on
  `ComplexAnalytic.refinePoly`, which `Oka/Analytification/CoverRefinement.lean` already works
  with. What the statement above buys is a *route*: a proof that a refined cover refines the same
  space may factor through the normalised datum, and if it does, this is the step it needs. **No
  such proof exists and this file is not evidence that one will take that route.**
* **Nothing about `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumPoly` itself**, and no refined datum: `glue`,
  `hrange`, `hsymm` and `hcocycle` for a cross-member refinement are taxis #1287's and are
  untouched.
* **No converse.** Nothing here says two data whose glued spaces agree must agree off the
  diagonal, and nothing needs it.
* **No `Iso`.** The conclusions are equalities of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`, which is what
  the `HEq` route gives and is stronger than an isomorphism; a caller who wants a morphism gets it
  from `CategoryTheory.eqToHom`.

the members are `ComplexAnalytic.coverSpace obj`, which never mentions `poly`. `V` is the only

/-! ### The diagonal-normalised datum -/

open Classical in
/-- **A cover datum's `glue`, carried to its diagonal-normalised form.**

Off the diagonal `ComplexAnalytic.polyDiagOne` changes nothing, so the two overlap presentations
are equal and the original isomorphism is carried by a `cast`. On the diagonal there is no
original to carry — `poly i i` has been replaced — and `CategoryTheory.eqToIso` of the equality
`i = j` forces is the choice; `ComplexAnalytic.hsymm_glueDiagOne` is the only thing that reads it,
and the glue datum reads it not at all.

**A `cast` and not a conjugation by two `CategoryTheory.eqToIso`s.** The two are the same
isomorphism, but `cast_heq` is a one-line proof of `ComplexAnalytic.heq_glueDiagOne`, which is the
hypothesis everything below consumes, where the conjugated form would need the transport unwound
at each end. -/

/-- **The symmetry hypothesis transports**, including at the diagonal.

The two cases are different arguments and neither covers the other. Off the diagonal the
transported isomorphism is the original one, so the original hypothesis is all that is used. On
the diagonal both sides are `CategoryTheory.eqToIso` of a proof of an equality of one object with
itself, and a proof of `X = X` is `rfl` by proof irrelevance — so the value is
`CategoryTheory.Iso.refl` and is its own inverse. This is the one place in the file where the
diagonal is looked at, and it is looked at because `hsymm` is the one hypothesis of a cover datum
that is quantified over every pair. -/

/-- **A cover datum and its diagonal-normalised form glue to the same analytic space.**

The statement `Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberDatum.lean` recorded as argued and not compiled,
in its section *Why normalising the diagonal is allowed, and it is not a new hypothesis on the
caller*, which now cites this declaration instead. The normalised datum's three hypotheses are
supplied and not assumed: `ComplexAnalytic.hrange_congr` and `ComplexAnalytic.hcocycle_congr`
transport because they are stated at distinct indices, and `ComplexAnalytic.hsymm_glueDiagOne`
covers the diagonal separately.

Nothing here is named against an elaborator budget: an earlier version of this proof named
`poly`, `poly'`, `glue`, `glue'` and all six `Prop` arguments against a timeout that does not
reproduce, and this file's module docstring records what was measured. -/
