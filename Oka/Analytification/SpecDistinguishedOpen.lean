# `Spec` of the structure map `A ⟶ A_f` is an open immersion

`Oka/Analytification/LocalisationFunctor.lean` proves the analytic half of this:
`ComplexAnalytic.isOpenImmersion_analytificationMap_localisationPresHom` says the *analytification*
of the structure map is an open immersion, and its docstring says why it is stated in that
spelling — a glue data assembled out of `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFunctor` holds its
morphisms in that form, and `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData`'s `f_open` field is
checked against the morphism one actually has.

This file is the same statement for `ComplexAnalytic.specFunctor`. It is what a glue data on the
`Spec` side of the same cover will hold, and that glue datum is the *target* of the comparison
morphism `X^an ⟶ X` for a glued scheme: `ComplexAnalytic.comm_coverGlueData` and
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData.glueMorphisms` already produce a morphism out of
`X^an` into **any** locally ringed space, so what is missing on that line is the space on the
right and not the gluing.

## The proof is a triangle over `A`, and the file exists for its two ends

`ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentedAlgebraEquiv` identifies `ℂ[x, t] ⧸ (g, t·f - 1)` with
`Localization.Away (mk f)`, and
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentedAlgebraEquiv_localisationRingHom` says that identification
is an isomorphism **over `A`** — the structure map composed with it is
the localisation's own `algebraMap`. Mathlib knows `Spec` of that `algebraMap` is an open
immersion. So the content here is one commuting triangle and one rewrite, and everything else is
where the two halves live: `ComplexAnalytic.specFunctor` is in
`Oka/Analytification/Comparison.lean` and the compatibility is in
`Oka/Analytification/LocalisationIndependence.lean`, and **no file in this repository imports
both**. Hence a file rather than a section.

## Mathlib's scheme-level open immersions are available to this repository's glue data, and that
is worth more than the lemma

`AlgebraicGeometry.Spec.locallyRingedSpaceMap` — the spelling `ComplexAnalytic.specFunctor` is
built from, because a `GlueData` here is a locally-ringed-space object — is the same term as
`AlgebraicGeometry.Spec.map`'s underlying morphism: `(Spec.map φ).toLRSHom =
Spec.locallyRingedSpaceMap φ` is `rfl`, and `AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion` is
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion` of that. So every open immersion Mathlib
proves about `Spec.map` is one about the morphisms this repository glues with.

**Instance search does not cross that identity**, which is why it has to be written down:
`inferInstance` at
`LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion (Spec.locallyRingedSpaceMap (CommRingCat.ofHom (algebraMap R
(Localization.Away f))))` fails, while `inferInstanceAs` at the scheme-level spelling succeeds.
Measured 2026-08-30. `ComplexAnalytic.isOpenImmersion_specFunctor_map_localisationHom` below is
that crossing at the one place this development needs it, and its proof term is the scheme-level
theorem with no transport at all.

## Why not `AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion.of_isLocalization`

Mathlib has exactly this statement for any `[IsLocalization.Away f S]`, which would make the proof
one line. It is not used, and the reason is a decision `Oka/Analytification/DistinguishedOpen.lean`
argues for in its own docstring: there is deliberately **no** `IsLocalization.Away` instance, and
no `Algebra (ComplexAnalytic.PresentedAlgebra n k g)` instance, on the localised presented algebra
— the identification is an isomorphism a consumer applies, not an instance keyed on a type this
development uses everywhere. Going through `ComplexAnalytic.specLocalisationRingIso` respects that
and costs three lines.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.specLocalisationRingIso`: `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentedAlgebraEquiv`,
  as an isomorphism in `CommRingCat` — the form `AlgebraicGeometry.Spec.map` consumes.
- `ComplexAnalytic.specLocalisationOpen`: `D(f) ⊆ Spec A`, as an open subset.
- `ComplexAnalytic.specLocalisationIso`: **the isomorphism `Spec (A_f) ≅ Spec A|D(f)`.**

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.localisationRingHom_comp_eq`: **the triangle over `A`**, in `CommRingCat`:
  the structure map followed by the identification is the localisation's own structure map into
  `Localization.Away`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isOpenImmersion_Spec_map_localisationRingHom`: **`Spec` of the structure map
  `A ⟶ A_f` is an open immersion**, at the scheme-level spelling, which is where Mathlib's API is.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isOpenImmersion_specFunctor_map_localisationHom`: the same for
  `ComplexAnalytic.specFunctor`'s value on the structure map — the spelling a glue data on the
  `Spec` side will hold, and the mirror of
  `ComplexAnalytic.isOpenImmersion_analytificationMap_localisationPresHom`. **This one is an
  `instance`** and the one above is not, because this is the spelling a glue datum presents to
  instance search; its docstring says so. The morphism of presentations it is taken at is named
  there rather than here: it is a definition, and `## Main results` is a list of results.
- `ComplexAnalytic.range_base_specFunctor_map_localisationHom`: **its image is exactly `D(f)`** —
  the equality, since the side condition of an open-immersion lift is a containment *in* a range,
  and what a `Spec`-side glue data's `hrange` obligation will be checked against.
- `ComplexAnalytic.specLocalisationIso_hom_ofRestrict` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.specLocalisationIso_inv_specFunctor_map`: **the isomorphism is one over
  `Spec A`.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.opensRange_Spec_map_localisationRingHom`: **the same image statement at
  `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.opensRange`**, which is the spelling a consumer that *composes*
  this open immersion with another needs, since
  `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.opensRange_comp` has no `Set.range` form. What it costs is
  recorded in its own docstring and in the first bullet below.

## What is not here

* **Neither spelling of the range is absent any more — this bullet recorded the scheme-level one
  as missing and it is not.** `ComplexAnalytic.opensRange_Spec_map_localisationRingHom` above is
  `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.opensRange` at the structure map, proved out of
  `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.opensRange_localizationAway`, and it was added when a consumer
  that composes appeared. **The reason this bullet gave was right and is worth keeping**, because
  it is what the proof pays and not what the statement pays:
  `ComplexAnalytic.range_base_specFunctor_map_localisationHom` says the same thing at
  `Set.range … .base`, and it is stated that way because
  `ComplexAnalytic.specLocalisationOpen` is declared at the `ComplexAnalytic.specFunctor.obj`
  spelling: the `Opens → Set` coercion then lands in the type the range already lives in, and the
  unification the scheme-level spelling asks for — between `↥(Spec (CommRingCat.of
  (PresentedAlgebra n k g)))` and `PrimeSpectrum ↑(CommRingCat.of (PresentedAlgebra n k g))`,
  definitionally equal and not unified through that coercion — never arises **there**. It arises
  here, in the `rw` and not in the statement, and `simp only` is what abstracts the instance
  argument that makes the motive ill-typed. **Which of the two a `Spec`-side glue data wants is
  answered**: `Oka/Analytification/SpecAffineCover.lean`'s
  `ComplexAnalytic.specOpen` — the `V` of its glue datum — is `ComplexAnalytic.specLocalisationOpen`
  and nothing else, so it wants the `ComplexAnalytic.specFunctor.obj` spelling, which is the one
  this file has.
* **The `Spec`-side glue data, and the comparison morphism `X^an ⟶ X`.** They are
  `Oka/Analytification/SpecAffineCover.lean` and `Oka/Analytification/CoverComparison.lean` now,
  and **what they took from this file is the *open* and the *isomorphism*, not `f_open`**:
  `ComplexAnalytic.specLocalisationOpen` is that file's `ComplexAnalytic.specOpen` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.specLocalisationIso` is its `ComplexAnalytic.specOverlapIso`, while the glue
  datum's `f_open` field comes from
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isOpenImmersion_ofRestrict` through
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isOpenImmersion_f'`, which is the same choice the analytic
  side makes. **This bullet predicted "`f_open` and nothing else" and the delivered construction
  inverted it**, which is what a forward reference costs when the file it points at is written by
  somebody else. The `hrange` hypothesis that construction also needs is a statement about ranges
  of maps on points, and unlike the cocycle equation it does not transport along a functor — that
  half of the prediction held.
* **Anything analytic.** No morphism of analytic spaces appears below, and nothing in
  `Oka/Analytification/AffineCover.lean` changes.

/-! ### The identification of the localised presentation, in `CommRingCat` -/

/-- **`ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentedAlgebraEquiv` as an isomorphism in `CommRingCat`**:
`ℂ[x, t] ⧸ (g, t·f - 1)` and `Localization.Away (mk f)` are the same object of the category
`AlgebraicGeometry.Spec.map` is a functor out of.

A `≃ₐ[ℂ]` cannot be handed to `AlgebraicGeometry.Spec.map`, and the two rewrites below are about
composites of `CommRingCat` morphisms, so the bundled form is what both of them need. -/
def specLocalisationRingIso :
    CommRingCat.of (PresentedAlgebra.{u} (n + 1) (k + 1) (localisationPresentation.{u} g f)) ≅
      CommRingCat.of (Localization.Away (Ideal.Quotient.mk (presentationIdeal.{u} g) f)) :=
  (localisationPresentedAlgebraEquiv.{u} g f).toRingEquiv.toCommRingCatIso

/-- **The triangle over `A`**: the structure map `A ⟶ A_f`, followed by the identification of
`A_f` with the localisation, is the localisation's own `algebraMap`.

This is `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentedAlgebraEquiv_localisationRingHom` — the statement
that the identification is an isomorphism over `A` and not merely over `ℂ` — read in
`CommRingCat`, which is the only thing the two results below use it for. -/
theorem localisationRingHom_comp_eq :
    CommRingCat.ofHom (localisationRingHom.{u} g f) ≫ (specLocalisationRingIso.{u} g f).hom =
      CommRingCat.ofHom (algebraMap (PresentedAlgebra.{u} n k g)
        (Localization.Away (Ideal.Quotient.mk (presentationIdeal.{u} g) f))) :=
  CommRingCat.hom_ext (RingHom.ext (localisationPresentedAlgebraEquiv_localisationRingHom.{u} g f))

/-! ### The open immersion -/

/-- **`Spec` of the structure map `A ⟶ A_f` is an open immersion.**

The structure map is the localisation's `algebraMap` composed with an isomorphism, by the triangle
above; `AlgebraicGeometry.Spec.map` turns that into a composite of `Spec` of the `algebraMap` —
where Mathlib's `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.isOpenImmersion_SpecMap_localizationAway` applies — with
an isomorphism, and open immersions absorb isomorphisms.

Stated at the scheme-level spelling because that is where Mathlib's API is; the locally ringed
space this repository glues with is the same term, which is the next declaration. -/

/-- **The functor's value on the structure map is an open immersion**, which is the form a glue
data on the `Spec` side of an affine cover holds its morphisms in.

**An `instance`, and stated at the `ComplexAnalytic.specFunctor` spelling rather than at
`AlgebraicGeometry.Spec.map`, because that is the one a glue datum presents to instance search.**
Two declarations below take it as one, both through
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion.isoOfRangeEq`:
`ComplexAnalytic.specLocalisationIso`, and `ComplexAnalytic.specLocalisationIso_hom_ofRestrict`
through that lemma's `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion.isoOfRangeEq_hom_fac`.
Demoting this declaration back to a `theorem` leaves exactly those two failing and nothing else,
which is how the pair was found rather than guessed. An instance at the other spelling would be
found for a goal about this one only up to the reducible unfolding the theorem above records, and
**instance search does not cross that identity** — measured in this file's module docstring.

Taken at `ComplexAnalytic.localisationHom`, which is the structure map read as a morphism of
*objects* of `ComplexAnalytic.Presentation` — `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresHom` does not
elaborate against `Functor.map`, for the reason its own docstring gives.

The mirror of `ComplexAnalytic.isOpenImmersion_analytificationMap_localisationPresHom`, and the
proof is the theorem above **with no transport**: `ComplexAnalytic.specFunctor.map` is
`AlgebraicGeometry.Spec.locallyRingedSpaceMap` of the underlying ring map, which is
`(AlgebraicGeometry.Spec.map _).toLRSHom`, and `AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion` of a scheme
morphism is `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion` of that, so the declaration is
what makes the scheme-level API reachable from a locally-ringed-space glue data. -/
instance isOpenImmersion_specFunctor_map_localisationHom :
    LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion (specFunctor.{u}.map (localisationHom.{u} g f)) :=
  isOpenImmersion_Spec_map_localisationRingHom.{u} g f

/-! ### The image of the morphism -/

/-- **`D(f) ⊆ Spec A`**, the basic open at the class of `f`, as an open subset of
`ComplexAnalytic.specFunctor`'s value.

The counterpart of `ComplexAnalytic.localisationOpen`, and the two are deliberately not related
here: one is a non-vanishing locus in an analytic space and the other a basic open of a spectrum,
and the statement that the comparison morphism carries the second to the first is about a cover
and belongs wherever that cover is built.

**Naming it is what makes the range statable**, and that is the whole of the difficulty this
file's `## What is not here` used to record: a bare
`Set.range … = ↑(PrimeSpectrum.basicOpen (mk f))` asks the `Opens → Set` coercion to unify
`↥(specFunctor.obj ⟨n, k, g⟩)` with `PrimeSpectrum ↑(CommRingCat.of (PresentedAlgebra n k g))`,
which are definitionally equal and do not unify through it. An `Opens` declared **at the
`specFunctor.obj` spelling** never poses that question, because its coercion is to a set of the
type the range already lives in. -/
def specLocalisationOpen : TopologicalSpace.Opens (specFunctor.{u}.obj ⟨n, k, g⟩) :=
  PrimeSpectrum.basicOpen (Ideal.Quotient.mk (presentationIdeal.{u} g) f)

/-- **The image of the morphism is exactly `D(f)`.**

The equality and not the containment, for the reason
`ComplexAnalytic.range_base_localisationProj` gives on the analytic side: the side condition of an
open-immersion lift is a containment *in* this range, so an equality is what lets a statement about
`D(f)` discharge it. It is what a `Spec`-side glue data's `hrange` obligation will be checked
against — **still a prediction, and the reason nothing has tested it is not the one to reach for
first.** The tree has three `hrange` obligations: `ComplexAnalytic.hrange_lineCover` and
`ComplexAnalytic.specHrange_lineCover` are vacuous at two members, but
`ComplexAnalytic.hrange_nodeCover` is at three and its proof is real. **All three are discharged
without this theorem**, and the non-vacuous one goes through
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.range_ofRestrict` as
`ComplexAnalytic.range_specTransitionHom_subset` does. So what is untested is not the containment
but **the equality** — nothing has yet needed the range of a distinguished open's inclusion to be
*exactly* `D(f)` rather than contained in it, which is what a three-member `Spec`-side cover would
be the first thing to ask for.

The triangle over `A` again: the isomorphism's half is surjective, and
`PrimeSpectrum.localization_away_comap_range` supplies the algebra map's half. -/

section OpensRange

attribute [local instance] isOpenImmersion_Spec_map_localisationRingHom

/-- **The range of `Spec` of the structure map is `D(f)`**, at
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.opensRange` — Mathlib's idiomatic spelling, and the one a consumer
that composes this morphism with another open immersion has to have.

`ComplexAnalytic.range_base_specFunctor_map_localisationHom` above is the same fact at
`Set.range … .base` and at the `ComplexAnalytic.specFunctor.obj` spelling, which is what a
`Spec`-side glue datum wants. **This one is for a consumer that is composing**, since
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.opensRange_comp` is stated at `opensRange` and has no `Set.range`
form: `Oka/Analytification/SpecRefinedMember.lean` is the first such consumer.

**The unification this file's `## What is not here` priced is real and it is the `rw` that pays
it, not the statement.** The two `Opens` types — over `↥(Spec (CommRingCat.of (PresentedAlgebra n
k g)))` and over `PrimeSpectrum ↑(CommRingCat.of (PresentedAlgebra n k g))` — are definitionally
equal, so the statement elaborates; what fails is `rw`, with *"motive is not type correct"*,
because `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.opensRange` carries an
`AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion` argument that depends on the morphism being rewritten. **Two
things buy it and both are one word**: `simp only` rather than `rw`, which abstracts the instance
argument, and naming `R` explicitly in the final `exact`, since Mathlib's lemma is stated for
`R : CommRingCat` and the `algebraMap` here has a bare type as its source.

**`attribute [local instance]`, scoped to this section, rather than a `have`.** The instance is
needed to *state* the theorem, not only to prove it, so a `have` cannot supply it; and
`ComplexAnalytic.isOpenImmersion_Spec_map_localisationRingHom` is deliberately a theorem rather
than an instance, for the reason its sibling's docstring gives. Nothing above this section is
elaborated with it in scope. -/
