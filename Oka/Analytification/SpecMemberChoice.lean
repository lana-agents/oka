# The open at every point becomes a family of opens, chosen

`Oka/Analytification/SpecScheme.lean` says what a common refinement of two cover data needs, and
names three pieces: **two data and an isomorphism of what they glue**, **a choice of such an open
at every point**, and **the refined family assembled into a cover datum with its three laws**.
`Oka/Analytification/SpecTwoData.lean` is the first. `Oka/Analytification/SpecMemberSections.lean`
ends with `ComplexAnalytic.exists_index_mvPolynomial_basicOpen_specSchemeIotaMap`, which is the
second **at each point separately**: for every point of the first datum's scheme *there exist* a
member of each datum and polynomials in their own variables cutting out the same open, containing
that point.

**This file takes the word *choice* in that sentence.** One `choose` turns the pointwise
existential into four functions defined on the whole scheme — two indices and two polynomials —
and that is the entire content: no new mathematics, and `Classical.choice` at every point.

## What the index type is, said here rather than left to be inferred

**The four functions are indexed by the points of `X`.** That is not a cover datum's index type,
and nothing below claims it is. A refinement indexed by points is not a refinement anybody would
assemble — the assembly step chooses a *set* of opens and an index type for it, out of the family
below or otherwise, and that choice is not made here. **So this file is the second piece and not
the third**, and the third is `Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberDatum.lean`'s line, on the other
side of the comparison.

## Existential over four functions, and not four definitions

The `choose` below can as easily produce four `def`s with three theorems relating them, and that
is the shape a cover datum would consume. **This file states the existential**, for three reasons
worth having on the record rather than in a commit message:

* **Nothing consumes them.** Four `noncomputable` definitions whose value at every point is
  `Classical.choice` would be four names in the environment, four guards in
  `OkaTest/Axioms/Analytification.lean`, and no caller. A consumer that wants them recovers them
  from the statement below with the same one-tactic `choose` that produced it.
* **The definitions would not be canonical.** Nothing distinguishes one choice of index and
  polynomial at a point from another, so a `def` would name an arbitrary member of a class and
  every later statement about it would have to carry the arbitrariness anyway.
* **The existential is what a reader can use without unfolding.**
  `Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberChoice.lean`, which is the same step on the analytic side, made
  the same call: it ends at `ComplexAnalytic.exists_refineDatumCross`, an existential over three
  families with two laws, and its own `## What is not here` says of it that the file *"produces a
  choice"* and that *"applying `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlue` to it and reading the result back
  is a separate step"*. It stopped there with the field already waiting —
  `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlueNe` takes that choice as explicit arguments and is *upstream* of
  that file, in `Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberDatumGlue.lean`, its only import. So the precedent
  is for the existential, and it is stronger than this file needs: there, a field was waiting and
  the existential was still the right shape; here there is no field at all.

**If the assembly step lands and wants definitions, this is one `choose` away and the change is
additive.** Recording the decision rather than the alternative is the point of this section.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.exists_family_mvPolynomial_basicOpen_specSchemeIotaMap`: **the pointwise
  existential of `ComplexAnalytic.exists_index_mvPolynomial_basicOpen_specSchemeIotaMap` as four
  functions on the scheme** — at every point, the two chosen members' two chosen polynomials cut
  out the same open of the glued scheme, and that open contains the point.

## What is not here

* **No `poly`, no `glue`, and none of a cover datum's three laws**, so nothing here is or produces
  a common refinement. That is `Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberDatum.lean`,
  `Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberDatumGlue.lean` and the `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatum*.lean`
  files, and this file adds to none of them.
* **No index type for a refinement**, as the section above says: the family is indexed by points.
* **Nothing that constructs the isomorphism `Φ`**, in either direction. It is a hypothesis here
  exactly as it is in `Oka/Analytification/SpecTwoData.lean`, and nothing in this repository
  produces one.
* **Nothing analytic.** No analytification, no `X^an`, no comparison morphism: everything here is
  on the `Spec` side, about a scheme glued from presented algebras.
* **No statement that the chosen opens cover anything.** Every point lies in its own chosen open,
  which is what the theorem says; that the *range* of the family is a cover in any sense that a
  glue datum would accept is a statement about the assembly and is not made here.

/-- **The pointwise existential of
`ComplexAnalytic.exists_index_mvPolynomial_basicOpen_specSchemeIotaMap`, chosen into four
functions on the whole scheme.**

At an isomorphism `Φ` of what the two data glue, there are functions assigning to every point of
the first datum's scheme a member of each datum and a polynomial in each member's own variables,
such that the two opens those polynomials cut out agree and contain the point.

**`choose` is the whole proof and the dependency is the only thing in it that could fail**: `fam x`
is a polynomial in `(obj (idx x))`'s variables, so its type mentions `idx`, which is being chosen
in the same call. It elaborates.

**The functions are indexed by the points of the scheme**, which is not a cover datum's index type;
this file's `## What is not here` says so, and nothing below is a common refinement. -/
