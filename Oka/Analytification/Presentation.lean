# The analytification of a presented affine `ℂ`-algebra

Fix polynomials `g₁, …, g_k ∈ ℂ[x₁, …, x_n]` and write `I = (g₁, …, g_k)`. This file builds the
complex analytic space

```
X^an = { z ∈ ℂ^n | g₁ z = ⋯ = g_k z = 0 }
```

and the comparison morphism of locally ringed spaces `X^an ⟶ Spec (ℂ[x]/I)`.

The space is nothing new: it is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.zeroLocus` applied to the
polynomials read as holomorphic functions by `OkaRing.ofMvPolynomial`, and its structure sheaf
is coherent by Oka's theorem. What this file adds is the *comparison with algebraic geometry*:
the ring map that sends a polynomial to the holomorphic function it defines, restricted to
`X^an`, kills `I` — that is `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.c_app_eq_zero`, the statement that the
sections cutting a subspace out pull back to zero — so it factors through `ℂ[x]/I`, and the
`Γ`-`Spec` adjunction turns the factorisation into a morphism `X^an ⟶ Spec (ℂ[x]/I)`.

The content is then the identification of that morphism's map on points
(`ComplexAnalytic.mem_analytificationToSpec_base_asIdeal_iff`): the prime of `Spec (ℂ[x]/I)`
underneath `z ∈ X^an` is the ideal of functions vanishing at `z`. Without it the morphism would
be a formal composite; with it, it is the classical comparison map, it lands in the closed
points, and it is injective.

## What this is *not*, and the sentence to read before citing it

**`analytification g` depends on the tuple `g`, not on the algebra `ℂ[x]/I`, and nothing *in
this file* says otherwise.** There is no presentation-independence, no functoriality and no
universal property here; this file does not use `Hom(Z, ℂ^n) ≃ Γ(Z, 𝒪_Z)^n` and does not provide
it. The name `analytification` is used because that is what the object is, but every statement
below is a statement about a *chosen* presentation.

**Two of those three now exist next door, and a reader who needs them should go there rather
than conclude they are missing.** `Oka/Analytification/UniversalProperty.lean` proves the
mapping property — morphisms `Z ⟶ X^an` correspond to tuples of global sections of `𝒪_Z`
satisfying the equations — and deduces from it that the analytification depends only on the
**ideal** `(g₁, …, g_k)`, so that two tuples spanning the same ideal, of possibly different
lengths, give canonically isomorphic spaces. It also proves that
`ComplexAnalytic.polyToGlobal` below *is* substitution of the coordinates of `X^an`.

**What is still missing after that** is a change of *variables* — two presentations of the same
algebra in different numbers of variables — and functoriality. So the sentence to carry away is
narrower than it was: the construction is independent of the generators chosen for a fixed
ideal in a fixed polynomial ring, and independence of the presentation as a whole is open.

Also absent: the comparison of *structure sheaves*. `analytificationToSpec` is a morphism of
locally ringed spaces, so it carries a map `𝒪_{Spec} ⟶ π_* 𝒪_{X^an}`, but nothing here
identifies that map, and the flatness which would make analytification exact on coherent
sheaves is a separate and later question (a GAGA input, not needed for the construction). Its
map on **stalks** is identified next door, in `Oka/Analytification/PresentationStalk.lean`; the
flatness is still open.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.polySection`: a tuple of polynomials read as holomorphic functions on `ℂ^n`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.analytification`: **the analytic space cut out by a tuple of
  polynomials.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.presentationIdeal`: the ideal `(g₁, …, g_k)` they generate.
- `ComplexAnalytic.PresentedAlgebra`: the `ℂ`-algebra `ℂ[x₁, …, x_n] ⧸ (g₁, …, g_k)`, and
  `ComplexAnalytic.presentedAlgebraMap`, its structure map.
- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationι` and `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationIncl`: the closed
  immersion of `X^an` into `ℂ^n` presented as an open subspace of itself, and into `ℂ^n`
  itself. Which of the two a statement wants is not a matter of taste; see
  `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationIncl`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpec`: **the comparison morphism
  `X^an ⟶ Spec (ℂ[x]/I)`.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.quotientEval`: evaluation of an element of `ℂ[x]/I` at a point of `X^an`,
  which is well defined precisely because the points of `X^an` are the common zeros.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.mem_zeroLocus_polySection_iff`: **the points of `X^an` are the common zeros
  of the `gⱼ`.** This is `ComplexAnalytic.mem_zeroLocus_nodeSection_iff` for an arbitrary tuple.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.mem_toΓSpec_base_asIdeal_iff`: for **any** complex analytic
  space `Z`, the prime of `Spec Γ(Z, 𝒪_Z)` underneath `z` is the ideal of global sections
  vanishing at `z`. This mentions no polynomials and belongs beside the evaluation API of
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Evaluation.lean`; it is here only because that file does not import the
  `Γ`-`Spec` adjunction and should not acquire it for one lemma.
- `ComplexAnalytic.mem_analytificationToSpec_base_asIdeal_iff` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpec_base_asIdeal`: **the point of `Spec (ℂ[x]/I)`
  underneath `z` is the ideal of functions vanishing at `z`**, i.e. the kernel of
  `ComplexAnalytic.quotientEval`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isMaximal_analytificationToSpec_base_asIdeal` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpec_base_injective`: the comparison morphism lands in the
  closed points and is injective on points.
- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpec_comp_specMk`: **the comparison morphism is the
  restriction of `ℂ^n ⟶ Spec ℂ[x]`**, i.e. the evident square commutes.

## A note on namespaces, for whoever writes the next file in this directory

Everything here is in `ComplexAnalytic`, which is the convention across `Oka/AnalyticSpace/`.
**`Oka/Analytification/AffineSpace.lean`, next door, is not**: `complexSpaceToSpec`,
`okaGlobalOfMvPolynomial`, `mem_complexSpaceToSpec_base_asIdeal_iff` and their neighbours are
in the *root* namespace, as their guards in `OkaTest/Axioms/Analytification.lean` show. So a
docstring here that reaches for one of them must write it unqualified. That is not a hypothetical
— this file shipped with two `ComplexAnalytic.`-prefixed references to those names, both
dangling, and they were found by `#check`ing every backticked name in the file rather than by
reading.

/-! ### The space -/

/-- A tuple of polynomials, read as a tuple of holomorphic functions on `ℂ^n` by
`OkaRing.ofMvPolynomial`. `ComplexAnalytic.nodeSection` is this at `g = fun _ ↦ X₀ * X₁`. -/
def polySection (g : Fin k → MvPolynomial (ULift.{u} (Fin n)) ℂ) :
    Fin k → (complexAffineSpaceTop.{u} n).presheaf.obj (op ⊤) :=
  fun j ↦ OkaRing.ofMvPolynomial _ (g j)

/-- **The analytic space cut out by a tuple of polynomials**: the common zero locus of the `gⱼ`
in `ℂ^n`, with the structure sheaf `𝒪_{ℂ^n} ⧸ (g₁, …, g_k)`.

Its structure sheaf is coherent, by `AnalyticSpace.isCoherentStructureSheaf`; see
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoherentStructureSheaf_zeroLocus`. Read the module docstring
before citing this as *the* analytification: it depends on `g` and not only on the algebra
`ℂ[x]/(g)`. -/
def AnalyticSpace.analytification (g : Fin k → MvPolynomial (ULift.{u} (Fin n)) ℂ) :
    AnalyticSpace.{u} :=
  AnalyticSpace.zeroLocus ⊤ (polySection g)

/-- **The points of the analytification are the common zeros of the `gⱼ`.**

Without this the construction is a formal composite; this is what makes it the zero locus. The
proof is `ComplexAnalytic.mem_zeroLocus_nodeSection_iff`'s, for an arbitrary tuple: a germ of a
holomorphic function on `ℂ^n` is a non-unit exactly when the function vanishes, and the value
of `OkaRing.ofMvPolynomial p` is `MvPolynomial.eval`. -/

The one general fact needed below. It belongs with the evaluation API of
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Evaluation.lean` and is here only because that file does not import the
`Γ`-`Spec` adjunction; see the module docstring. -/

/-- **The prime of `Spec Γ(Z, 𝒪_Z)` underneath `z` is the ideal of global sections vanishing at
`z`**, for an arbitrary complex analytic space `Z`.

Both halves are already available and this only joins them: Mathlib's
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.notMem_prime_iff_unit_in_stalk` says the complement of the
prime consists of the sections with unit germ, and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.evalStalk_ne_zero_iff_isUnit` says a germ is a unit exactly when
its value is nonzero — which is the content of the residue field of `Z` being `ℂ`. -/

presented as an open subspace of itself: `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationι` followed by
`ofRestrict`.

Both spellings are needed and they are not interchangeable. `analytificationι` is the one the
construction runs through, because `OkaRing.ofMvPolynomial _ (g j)` at the open
`ComplexAnalytic.complexAffineSpaceTop` elaborates to *is* the cutting section, definitionally,
which is what makes `IsCutOutBy.c_app_eq_zero` apply on the nose. `analytificationIncl` is the
one a statement about `ℂ^n` — such as `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpec_comp_specMk` —
has to be phrased in. -/

This is the whole reason the comparison morphism exists, and it is
`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.c_app_eq_zero` on the nose: the sections cutting a subspace out pull
back to zero on it. No compatibility lemma is needed because `polySection g j` *is*
`OkaRing.ofMvPolynomial _ (g j)` by definition. -/

/-- Reading a polynomial as a section of `𝒪_{X^an}` is the same whether one restricts it from
`ℂ^n` or reads it directly on the open subspace `ℂ^n|⊤`.

**This is a `rfl`, and the reason is worth recording**, because taxis #702 established that
`functor.obj ⊤` and `⊤` are *not* definitionally equal even at `⊤` and even over `ℂ^n`, so an
arbitrary section would need a transport here. A polynomial does not, because
`Γ.map (ofRestrict U).op` is definitionally the restriction map of the presheaf, the restriction
map of `okaCommPresheaf` is definitionally `OkaRing.restrict`, and
`OkaRing.restrict_ofMvPolynomial` is itself a `rfl`: the *presentation* of the section does not
mention its open. -/

commutes. Together with `ComplexAnalytic.mem_analytificationToSpec_base_asIdeal_iff` this pins
`analytificationToSpec` down as the classical map.

The proof is formal — naturality of `toΓSpec`, functoriality of `Spec`, and
`ComplexAnalytic.mk_comp_quotientToGlobal` — and uses nothing analytic. -/
