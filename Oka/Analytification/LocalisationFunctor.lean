# The projection of a distinguished open is the analytification of the localisation map

`Oka/Analytification/DistinguishedOpen.lean` builds `ComplexAnalytic.localisationProj`, the
morphism `(A_f)^an ⟶ X^an`, out of the universal property: it is `liftHom` applied to the first
`n` coordinates. That says nothing about where the morphism *comes from*, and the construction
that consumes it — gluing an analytic space out of an affine cover — needs it to be the value of
the **functor** on the localisation map, because the transition isomorphisms of a glue data are
produced from isomorphisms of `ℂ`-algebras and nothing else.

This file supplies that link: `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationMap_localisationPresHom` says
`localisationProj` is `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationMap` of the structure map `A ⟶ A_f`.

It is a separate file rather than a section of `Oka/Analytification/DistinguishedOpen.lean`
because that file imports only `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Nonvanishing.lean` and
`Oka/Analytification/UniversalProperty.lean`, and the functor lives two files further on; the
theorem below is the only thing there that needs it.

## Which way the arrows go

`ComplexAnalytic.PresHom g g'` carries a ring map `PresentedAlgebra g' →+* PresentedAlgebra g`
and induces `analytification g ⟶ analytification g'`, so a morphism *of presentations* out of the
localisation is an algebra map **into** it. That is why
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresHom` has type `PresHom (localisationPresentation g f) g` and its
ring map is `A ⟶ A_f`: the two directions are the same statement read in opposite categories.

## Nothing here is about localisation

The ring map is induced by `MvPolynomial.rename (localisationIncl n)`, so it is an instance of
`ComplexAnalytic.PresHom.ofRename`, and the only thing to check is the hypothesis that construction
asks for: that the old equations, renamed, lie in the new ideal. They *are* new equations, by
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentation_castSucc`. **That `PresentedAlgebra
(localisationPresentation g f)` is a localisation of `PresentedAlgebra g` is not proved here or
anywhere**; it is not needed, because a structure map is all a `PresHom` wants. See
`Oka/Analytification/DistinguishedOpen.lean` on the naming.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresHom`: the `ℂ`-algebra map `A ⟶ A_f`, as a morphism of
  presentations.
- `ComplexAnalytic.localisationRingHom`: the same, as a bare ring map of presented algebras.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationMap_localisationPresHom` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFunctor_map_localisationPresHom`: **the projection of a
  distinguished open is the analytification of the structure map**, as a bare morphism and as the
  functor's value.
- `ComplexAnalytic.localisationIso_inv_analytificationMap`: the inclusion of the open subspace,
  read through the functor — the form a glue data consumes.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isOpenImmersion_analytificationMap_localisationPresHom`: **the functor's value
  on the structure map is an open immersion**, which is
  `ComplexAnalytic.isOpenImmersion_localisationProj` at this spelling and is the one a glue data
  built out of `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFunctor` will hold.

`ComplexAnalytic.PresHom` points from the localisation to `A`.

It is `ComplexAnalytic.PresHom.ofRename` at `ComplexAnalytic.localisationIncl`: adjoining a
variable is a renaming of the variables, and the commutation with the structure maps that a
`PresHom` demands is `MvPolynomial.rename_C`, discharged there once and for all. -/

`(A_f)^an`, which is exactly the tuple `ComplexAnalytic.localisationProj` was built from. This is
the whole content of the identification below. -/

/-- **The projection of a distinguished open is the analytification of the structure map.**

Both sides are morphisms into `X^an`, so `ComplexAnalytic.hom_ext_analytification` reduces it to
the coordinates, where one side is `ComplexAnalytic.coordPullback_analytificationMap_comp` and the
other `ComplexAnalytic.coordPullback_localisationProj_comp`, and the two tuples agree by
`ComplexAnalytic.transported_localisationPresHom`. -/

/-- **The same, as the functor's value on a morphism of `ComplexAnalytic.Presentation`.** This is

/-- **The inclusion of `D(f)` into `X^an`, read through the functor.**

`ComplexAnalytic.localisationIso_inv_localisationProj` says the inclusion is the inverse of the
comparison followed by the projection; with the identification above, the projection is the
analytification of an algebra map. So this exhibits `ofRestrict` — the open immersion, which is
not built from any algebra — as a composite of the comparison isomorphism with a morphism
produced by the functor from a `ℂ`-algebra map, and that is the form in which a glue data uses
it. -/

/-- **The functor's value on the structure map `A ⟶ A_f` is an open immersion.**

`ComplexAnalytic.isOpenImmersion_localisationProj` at this spelling, by
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationMap_localisationPresHom`. It is stated separately because a glue
data assembled out of `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFunctor` holds its morphisms in this form
and not as `ComplexAnalytic.localisationProj`, and
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData`'s `f_open` field is checked against the morphism
one actually has. -/
