# The analytification is Hausdorff, and the standard étale cover is a covering map

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Hausdorff.lean` makes the zero locus of holomorphic functions on an open subset
of `ℂ^n` Hausdorff. `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.analytification` is such a zero locus — at
`V = ⊤`, with the polynomials read as holomorphic functions by `ComplexAnalytic.polySection` — so
it is one more `inferInstanceAs`, and that is the whole of the first declaration here.

**The second and third are what the first is for.**
`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleFiniteEtale.lean` proves that the analytification of a standard
étale morphism is finite étale over an open subset of the base, and its `## What is not here` ends
with a bullet saying that the covering-map rung is out of reach because
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoveringMap_base_of_isFiniteEtale` *"needs a Hausdorff source and
it is not checked here"*. The source is
`(ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.analytification …).restrict …`, which the instance below and
`ComplexAnalytic.t2Space_restrict` reach, so the bullet closes and the corollary is a `haveI` and
an application.

## Why this is the second application of the third rung and the first outside a test file

`ComplexAnalytic.isCoveringMap_base_sq` (`OkaTest/FiniteMorphism.lean`) is the only other one.
**That file said so three times, in the present tense, and this branch narrows all three rather
than citing one of them as authority for a count it falsifies** — its module docstring, the section
docstring of the section that declaration sits in, and that declaration's own docstring. Each keeps
the clause that survives, which is that `ComplexAnalytic.isCoveringMap_base_sq` is still the only
application at a morphism that repository proves is not an isomorphism
(`ComplexAnalytic.not_isIso_sq`); nothing shows that of the morphism below. **The grep that reaches
those three is on this rung's name and not on `T2Space`**, which no widening of a separation-axiom
sweep could have found: when a hypothesis is discharged, the sentences that go stale are about the
theorem the hypothesis was gating. It is the squaring map of the punctured line, written by hand,
with its separation hypothesis supplied by a bespoke instance about that one space
(`ComplexAnalytic.t2Space_restrict_punctured`). The theorems below are about a morphism the
analytification machinery produces from a Mathlib `StandardEtalePair`, and their
separation hypothesis is found by instance search at a family rather than at a point — which is
the difference `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Hausdorff.lean` is for.

**Nothing about the covering is computed.** `IsCoveringMap` is a statement about the underlying
continuous map, so these say nothing about structure sheaves, nothing about how many sheets there
are, and nothing about whether the base is nonempty; the last of those is a live question about
`V`, and `Oka/Analytification/OpenBaseFiniteness.lean` is where it is discussed.

## What is not here

* **No degree, and no number of sheets.**
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.card_fiber_eq_of_isFiniteEtale` would apply to the same morphism —
  its `[T2Space]` on the source is now discharged — but it also asks `[PreconnectedSpace]` of the
  base, and `V` is an arbitrary open subset of `ℂ^n` avoiding the bad set, which nothing here shows
  is preconnected or even nonempty. That is a second hypothesis and a second deliverable.
* **Nothing at `k ≥ 1`.** These are corollaries of
  `ComplexAnalytic.isFiniteEtale_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp` and inherit its
  `g : Fin 0 → …`; the finiteness half over a presented base does not exist, so neither does this.
* **Nothing about the unrestricted morphism.** It is not finite étale —
  `ComplexAnalytic.not_isFiniteEtale_condEtaleProj` (`OkaTest/StandardEtaleNotFinite.lean`) — so
  there is no covering-map statement to make about it, and the restriction to `V` is not an
  artefact of this file.
* **No comparison functor and no Riemann existence theorem**, and no covering-map statement about
  the analytification of a finite étale morphism of schemes: everything here is one standard étale
  presentation over `ℂ^n`.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.t2Space_analytification`: **the analytification of a tuple of polynomials is
  Hausdorff.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.isCoveringMap_base_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.isCoveringMap_base_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp_compl`:
  **the analytification of a standard étale morphism over `ℂ^n` is a covering map over an open
  subset of the base avoiding the bad set**, and at the complement of the bad set itself.

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.analytification` is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.zeroLocus ⊤`

/-- **The analytification of a standard étale morphism over `ℂ^n` is a covering map over an open
subset of the base avoiding the bad set.**

`ComplexAnalytic.isFiniteEtale_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp` is the whole of
the input, and the separation hypothesis of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoveringMap_base_of_isFiniteEtale` is found by instance search:
the source is an open subspace of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.analytification`, which
`ComplexAnalytic.t2Space_analytification` and `ComplexAnalytic.t2Space_restrict` reach.

The hypotheses are the finite-étale theorem's and they are not redistributed here: `hF` and `hV`
buy finiteness, `P`, `hFP` and `hGP` buy the local isomorphism, and the covering-map rung reads
both fields and no separation of the base. -/
