# The refined cover's space maps onto the one it refines, when the refining family covers

`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumToBase.lean` builds `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumToBase`, the
morphism from a cross-member refinement's analytic space down to the cover it refines, and its own
`## What is not here` records what that does not say:

> * **Nothing that says the refined datum covers the original space.**
>   `Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberDatum.lean`'s *"No statement that the refined data cover
>   anything"* is untouched: a morphism down is not a covering, and the surjectivity of this one is
>   not proved, stated, or needed below.

**This file supplies the surjectivity**, under the condition that the refining family covers, and
computes the image with no condition at all. **It says nothing about injectivity and nothing about
either morphism being an isomorphism**; that bullet's neighbours in the same list are untouched.

## The image is a theorem and the covering is a hypothesis, and that split is the file

`ComplexAnalytic.coverIota_comp_refineDatumToBase` says the morphism restricts on the `b`-th
refined member to `ComplexAnalytic.localisationProj` followed by
`ComplexAnalytic.coverIota (σ b)`. Reading that at a point in both directions gives the image
outright:

`ComplexAnalytic.range_base_refineDatumToBase` — **the image is the union over `b` of the images of
`D(fam b)`, for every cross-member refinement, on no hypothesis beyond the ones the morphism
already takes.** Its `⊆` is the refined glue data's
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData.ι_jointly_surjective` and
`ComplexAnalytic.range_base_localisationProj_subset`; its `⊇` is
`ComplexAnalytic.range_base_localisationProj`, the *equality* — this is the one place on this line
where the containment is not enough, since a point of `D(fam b)` has to be produced from upstairs
rather than merely landed in.

Every statement about the *morphism* here is a corollary of it, including the converse:
`ComplexAnalytic.surjective_base_refineDatumToBase_iff` is `Set.range_eq_univ` at that equation and
says what surjectivity is actually equivalent to. **The condition's own consequence is not one of
them**: `ComplexAnalytic.iUnion_coverIota_image_localisationOpen_eq_univ` says the images of the
refined members exhaust `X^an` with no morphism in its statement or its proof, and the surjectivity
above is that lemma composed with this equation. That is where the hypothesis is spent, and it is
why the open cover below is available at data for which no refined datum has been built.

## Why the condition is stated per member and not per point of the glued space

`ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumCovers` asks that every point of every *member* of the original cover
lie in a refined member over that member. **The glued-space form — every point of `X^an` lies in
the image of some refined member — is strictly weaker and would make the sufficiency below almost
vacuous**, since the members are glued along their overlaps and a point of the `i`-th member can be
reached through a different one. What the union in `range_base_refineDatumToBase` being everything
says is the weak form; that is the equivalence, and it is why the sufficient condition is stated
separately rather than being read off the iff.

**That the two differ is a theorem here and not a design note**, and the section below is the
witness. This paragraph asserted the strictness with nothing behind it when the file landed, and a
non-implication asserted flatly is exactly what this line of files asks a branch not to do.

## The strictness, and the shape of the counterexample

`ComplexAnalytic.dupStrict`: **a cover datum, an index map and a refining family for which the
morphism down is surjective and `ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumCovers` is false.** So the sufficient
condition is not necessary, and what surjectivity is equivalent to really is the weaker statement.

The mechanism is the one the paragraph above names, at its extreme: `ComplexAnalytic.dupObj` is
**two copies of one presentation glued along the whole of each**, so either member alone is the
whole gluing and the second is redundant, and `ComplexAnalytic.dupSigma` misses it. The general
reason is `ComplexAnalytic.mem_range_of_refineDatumCovers` — **the per-member condition forces the
index map to hit every index whose member has a point**, which is a demand the glued-space form
does not make, and it is why `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOneCovers` needs `Function.Surjective σ`
at all.

**Two of the three things this needed were already in the tree**, and grepping for them cost less
than the two lemmas it saved. `ComplexAnalytic.surjective_ι_coverGlueData` is the redundancy
argument, in the exact hypothesis shape a constant `poly` produces;
`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.hRange_of_no_three` and
`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.hCocycle_of_no_three` make two of the three cover-datum laws free below
three members. So the datum itself costs an `Iso.refl` and one `Iso.refl_symm`.

**Nothing in that section bears on `ComplexAnalytic.lineRefinement`**, in either direction: its
family is `fam ≡ 1`, which refines nothing.

The per-member form is also the one `Oka/Analytification/CoverRefinement.lean` names, in the
sentence `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumToBase.lean` quotes when it declines to state it: *"what
would make a comparison an isomorphism is the condition … that the refining family covers"*.

**`ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq` is what keeps the condition transport-free.** `fam b` is a
polynomial in the variables of `obj (σ b)` and the point is in the `i`-th member, so a naïve
spelling needs `h ▸ fam b` or `h ▸ y` along `h : σ b = i`;
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumRange.lean` declares that identification for exactly this problem,
records in its own docstring what the unascribed spelling costs, and it is already the vocabulary
`ComplexAnalytic.comm_refineDatumMapPart`'s equal branch is written in. Its two consumers here are
`ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq_self`, in the sufficiency, and
`ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq_refl`, in the instance.

## And the refined members are an open cover of `X^an`

`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumMemberIota` is the `b`-th refined member sitting in the space the
refinement refines — `ComplexAnalytic.localisationProj` and then
`ComplexAnalytic.coverIota (σ b)` — and `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOpenCover` is the family of
them as an `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.OpenCover`. **The two things the bullet this
retires priced for it are the `idx` choice and an open immersion for the composite**, and both are
one line: the choice is `Set.mem_iUnion` at the hypothesis, and the composite is an
open immersion because each factor is.

**Its hypothesis is that the ranges exhaust `X^an`, and not `ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumCovers`.**
That is the whole point of the strictness above: the condition is *strictly* stronger, so a cover
asked at it would be unavailable at exactly the data the weaker form admits.
`ComplexAnalytic.range_base_refineDatumToBase_eq_iUnion_range` identifies the hypothesis with the
surjectivity of the morphism down, so the three statements this file is about — the condition, the
surjectivity, and the members being a cover — are the two implications and the equivalence they
already were, with the cover added at the weak end.

**Nothing in the definition reads the refined datum.** `q`, the two choices and the three refined
laws appear only in the bridge to `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumToBase`, so the cover exists for
every index map and every refining family whose members exhaust the space, whether or not the
cross-member work has been done for them. That is not a small distinction on this line: the
cross-member equations are what taxis #1287 spent a fortnight on and what
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumUnitFamily.lean` still asks a unit hypothesis for.

## And the refined space has a cover of its own, which the morphism down carries to that one

`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGluedOpenCover` is the other cover the bullet above kept apart from
the first: the refined members covering **the space they glue to** rather than the space they
refine. It is the general cover's own open cover at the refined datum, so nothing is built for it
— what makes it worth a name is that it is the cover at which the restriction law
`ComplexAnalytic.coverIota_comp_refineDatumToBase` becomes a statement about two covers.

**That is `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOpenCover_map_eq_comp`, and it is more than the ranges.**
Every earlier statement here relates the two families through images —
`ComplexAnalytic.range_base_refineDatumToBase_eq_iUnion_range` is the sharpest of them — and an
equality of images is compatible with the two families being unrelated as morphisms. The
factorisation says the `b`-th map of the cover of `X^an` **is** the `b`-th map of the refined
space's own cover followed by the morphism down, at the same index, with no reindexing.

**The two covers have different hypotheses and that is not an asymmetry to repair.** The cover of
`X^an` reads no refined datum, so it exists wherever the refined members exhaust the space; the
cover of the refined space needs the datum, because the space does. The factorisation is stated
where both are available and takes no hypothesis of its own.

## The instance, and it is what stops the condition from being empty

`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOneCovers`: at `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumWitness.lean`'s trivial
refining family the condition holds as soon as `σ` is **surjective**, by
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationOpen_one` — `D(1)` is the whole member, so the only thing left to ask
is that some refined index lie over each original one. So
`ComplexAnalytic.surjective_base_refineDatumOneToBase`: that witness maps **onto** the cover it
refines, for every cover datum and every surjective index map. `OkaTest/RefineDatumWitness.lean`
instantiates it at `σ = id` on a three-element index type.

**`fam ≡ 1` is a reindexing and not a proper refinement**, which is what
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumWitness.lean` says of it in terms, so this instance is the trivial
end of the condition and not evidence about the other end. What it establishes is that
`ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumCovers` is satisfiable, which nothing else here would say.

## Why a module of its own rather than a line in either file it imports

**Because the instance needs both imports and neither file imports the other.**
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumToBase.lean` and `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumWitness.lean` both
sit directly on `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumCocycle.lean`, and their `Oka`-closures are equal
except that each contains itself. So an append into either buys the other as a new import, and the
choice is one `Oka` module either way.

**The closure figures, quoted so the trade is visible rather than implied**, computed with
`scripts/import_cost.py`'s comment-stripping reader imported by path — neither of that script's CLI
forms prices an `Oka/Analytification/` module — and with
`Oka/Analytification/SpecRefinedChoice.lean` as the control, whose published **92 / 72**
reproduces. At the time this module was created its closure was **97** `Oka` modules and **71**
Mathlib roots, itself counted in, against **96** and **71** for either append: **one `Oka` module
and no Mathlib root**, which is the same trade
`Oka/Analytification/SpecRefinedChoice.lean` recorded making for its own existence. That figure
is the argument's and not this file's, and the argument is unchanged by what has been imported
since.

**What this file's closure is *now* is a different number and it had gone stale twice.** The
strictness counterexample added two import lines and
`### The instance at a family that is a unit on each overlap` below adds one more, so the
figure today is **100** `Oka` modules and **73** Mathlib roots. Both columns had
drifted — the paragraph above read 97 and 71 while the tree read 99 and 73 — and the Mathlib
column is *roots* and not the transitive closure, which is why 73 appears here where a branch
counting transitively wrote 3362. **Say which you are counting or the number means nothing**, and
re-measure rather than adding to what is written: that section's import cost **`+1` `Oka`
module and `+0` Mathlib roots** measured on the branch that added it, with
`Oka/Analytification/AffineCover.lean` — already in the closure — quoted as a control reading
`+0` on both columns, as it must.

**The `## Main results` bullet for `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumToBase_base_coverIota` names a
theorem without citing it, and that is deliberate.** `scripts/guard_coverage.py` reads every
backticked repository name under a `## Main results` heading as a result *that* file advertises,
so citing
`ComplexAnalytic.coverIota_comp_refineDatumToBase` there would advertise another file's theorem
from this one — the live check whose figure has caught a defect on three separate branches.
`Oka/Analytification/AffineCover.lean` and `Oka/Analytification/CoverRefinement.lean` both record
the same workaround at bullets of their own: name the law, cite it from the prose above, and the
count stays a count of this file's results.

The tie is broken by what each candidate is for:

* `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumToBase.lean` is **the file whose `## What is not here` bullet
  this retires**, and appending a retirement into the file that records the absence is the shape
  this board has repeatedly said reads worst — the bullet and its refutation would be forty lines
  apart in one docstring.
* `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumWitness.lean` is a *witness* file. Its subject is the trivial
  family and the two adopted range conditions; the comparison morphism appears in it nowhere, and
  three of the five results below are about a general refinement with no witness in sight.

## And why the unit family's morphism is named here rather than beside the space it comes out of

**Because the trivial family's counterpart is already here, and the split is not arbitrary.**
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumWitness.lean` holds the trivial family's choices, its glue data and
its space; `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOneCovers` and
`ComplexAnalytic.surjective_base_refineDatumOneToBase` — the two statements about the *morphism
down* — are in this file. `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumUnitFamily.lean` stands to the unit family
exactly as that witness file stands to the trivial one, so its morphism belongs where the other
one's is.

**And it is the cheaper edge, measured both ways.** This file already imports
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumToBase.lean`, so gaining
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumUnitFamily.lean` costs it **one** `Oka` module and no Mathlib root.
The other direction costs more than it looks: appending into
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumUnitFamily.lean` would buy
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumToBase.lean` for `+1`, but the equivalence needs *this* file's
`ComplexAnalytic.surjective_base_refineDatumToBase_iff` as well, and that edge takes that file's
closure from **95** to **100** — `+5` `Oka` modules and `+2` Mathlib roots — or else splits the two
declarations across two files and pays two edges instead of one.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumCovers`: **the refining family covers** — every point of every member
  of the original cover lies in a refined member lying over that member.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumUnitFamToBase`: **the morphism down at an injective index map and a
  family that is a unit on each overlap**, whose source is written as the space
  `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumUnitFamAnalytification` and not as the fifteen arguments that space
  unfolds to.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumMemberIota`: **the `b`-th refined member sitting in the space the
  refinement refines** — its projection down to the member it lies over, then that member's
  inclusion — with no refined datum in it.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOpenCover`: **the refined members as an open cover of `X^an`**, at
  the hypothesis that their ranges exhaust it.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOneOpenCover`: **that cover at the trivial refining family and a
  surjective index map**, which is what stops the definition above from being one with no
  instance.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGluedOpenCover`: **the refined members as an open cover of the space
  they glue to**, which is the other of the two covers this file's `## What is not here` kept
  apart — a cover of the refined analytic space and not of `X^an`.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumToBase_base_coverIota`: **the morphism down, read at a point of a
  refined member** — the pointwise form of the restriction law the morphism's own file proves,
  which the two halves of the image computation spend in opposite directions.
- `ComplexAnalytic.range_base_refineDatumToBase`: **the image is the union of the images of the
  refined members**, on no hypothesis at all.
- `ComplexAnalytic.surjective_base_refineDatumToBase`: **so the morphism down is surjective when
  the refining family covers.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.surjective_base_refineDatumToBase_iff`: **and it is surjective exactly when that
  union is everything**, which is the converse the sufficient condition does not give.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOneCovers`: **the trivial refining family covers at every surjective
  index map**, for every cover datum.
- `ComplexAnalytic.surjective_base_refineDatumOneToBase`: **so the trivial family's witness maps
  onto the cover it refines.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.mem_range_of_refineDatumCovers` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.not_refineDatumCovers_of_notMem_range`: **the condition forces the index map to
  hit every index whose member has a point**, and the contrapositive the witness spends.
- `ComplexAnalytic.dupSurjective_refine` and `ComplexAnalytic.dupNot_refineDatumCovers`: **at two
  copies of one presentation glued along the whole of each, the morphism down is surjective and the
  condition fails.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.dupStrict`: **so the condition is strictly stronger than surjectivity**, the two
  halves at one refining family.
- `ComplexAnalytic.dupPtStrict`: **and the witness is not vacuous** — at the presentation of a
  point, whose analytification has one.
- `ComplexAnalytic.mem_localisationOpen_of_refineDatumCovers_id` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.localisationOpen_eq_top_of_refineDatumCovers_id`: **at an index map that is the
  identity the condition puts every point of a member in `D(fam i)`, so each `D(fam i)` is the
  whole of its member.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumCovers_id_of_forall_eq_top` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumCovers_id_iff`: **and conversely, so at an identity index map the
  condition *is* that equation** — a biconditional, and not a collapse asserted in prose.
- `ComplexAnalytic.not_refineDatumCovers_id_of_ne_top`: **so one member the family cuts down
  refutes it outright**, which is what a refinement that refines fails on. **Kept as its own name
  though `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumCovers_id_iff` now subsumes it**, for the reason the section
  header gives.
- `ComplexAnalytic.surjective_base_refineDatumUnitFamToBase_iff`: **and at a family that is a unit
  on each overlap the morphism down is surjective exactly when the images of the refined members
  are everything**, which is the equivalence above read at the arguments a proper refinement has,
  so that a caller does not spell fifteen of them to ask the question.
- `ComplexAnalytic.iUnion_coverIota_image_localisationOpen_eq_univ`: **the condition makes the
  images of the refined members exhaust the space**, with no morphism down in its statement or its
  proof — the lemma where the hypothesis is spent, and of which
  `ComplexAnalytic.surjective_base_refineDatumToBase` is now the image computation's corollary.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isOpenImmersion_refineDatumMemberIota` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.range_base_refineDatumMemberIota`: **each refined member is an open subspace of
  the glued space, and its image is the image of the open the family cuts out** — the two facts
  the open cover is assembled from.
- `ComplexAnalytic.iUnion_range_base_refineDatumMemberIota` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.iUnion_range_base_refineDatumMemberIota_eq_univ`: **the union of those ranges is
  the union this file's earlier statements are about, and the condition makes it everything.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOpenCover_obj` and `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOpenCover_map`:
  **the cover's members are the refined members' analytifications and its maps are
  `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumMemberIota`**, both definitional.
- `ComplexAnalytic.range_base_refineDatumToBase_eq_iUnion_range` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.surjective_base_refineDatumToBase_iff_iUnion_range`: **the image of the morphism
  down is that union, so the cover's hypothesis is exactly that morphism's surjectivity** — the
  only two statements in the section that read the refined datum.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGluedOpenCover_obj` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGluedOpenCover_map`: **that cover's members are the refined members'
  analytifications and its maps are the refined datum's own inclusions**, both definitional.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGluedOpenCover_map_comp_refineDatumToBase` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOpenCover_map_eq_comp`: **the morphism down carries each of those
  inclusions to the corresponding refined member of `X^an`, so the cover of `X^an` is the refined
  space's own cover composed with it** — map by map, where the statements above relate the two
  covers only through their ranges.

## What is not here

* **No injectivity, and no claim that anything is an isomorphism.** The image is computed and
  nothing below says a word about fibres. `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumToBase.lean`'s *"No
  morphism in the other direction, and no claim that this one is an isomorphism"* is untouched in
  both of its halves, and `ComplexAnalytic.not_isIso_refineToBase` — a negative about the
  one-member comparison at a constant `σ` — bears on nothing here, in either direction, for the
  reason that file gives.
* **Nothing about a refining family that is not a unit, beyond the reading at `σ = id`.**
  `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumUnitFamily.lean` builds the only refinement in this repository
  that cuts its members down. `### The condition at an index map that is the identity` below
  settles **one** of the two questions about it — it was the last section of this file when that
  sentence was written and is no longer, so it is named here rather than counted:
  its index map is the identity and its `D(z)` is a proper open of its chart, so
  `ComplexAnalytic.not_refineDatumCovers_id_of_ne_top` applies and that refinement does **not**
  meet `ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumCovers`. `OkaTest/RefineDatumUnitFamily.lean` is where that is
  instantiated, and nothing here mentions it.
  **Whether that refinement's `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumToBase` is surjective is a second
  question and the paragraph above is not evidence about it in either direction** —
  `ComplexAnalytic.dupStrict` is exactly the theorem that the condition is not necessary, so a
  datum that fails it may still have a surjection down. `OkaTest/RefineDatumUnitFamily.lean`
  answers that one too, separately and negatively, through
  `ComplexAnalytic.surjective_base_refineDatumToBase_iff` and a point of the glued space that is in
  the image of neither refined member. **Neither answer is derived from the other**, and nothing
  here is a statement about that refinement in either direction: what this file supplies is the
  general theorem the instance spends.
* **Neither of the two covers is `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.OpenCover.fromGlued` of the
  other.** **This bullet said the open cover here was of `X^an` and not of the refined space, and
  that nothing presented the members of the *refined* datum as a cover of the space they glue to**;
  the second half is `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGluedOpenCover` and the first is now a distinction
  between two definitions rather than an absence. What is still absent is the identification:
  `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumToBase` is not
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.OpenCover.fromGlued` of
  `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOpenCover`, and nothing here says the refined space is the gluing of
  that cover — `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOpenCover_map_eq_comp` says the maps factor, which is a
  statement about each member and not about the two spaces.
* **Nothing that says the refined datum *refines* the original space.**
  `Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberDatum.lean`'s remaining half — that the refined overlaps are cut
  out where `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumPoly` says they are — is a statement about that definition
  and is not this one; a surjection down is not a refinement of covers.
* **No instance in `Oka/` of `### The instance at a family that is a unit on each overlap`.**
  `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumUnitFamToBase` and its equivalence are stated for every cover datum
  and are spent in this library at none. **This bullet said `OkaTest/RefineDatumUnitFamily.lean`
  still spelled the morphism at fifteen arguments and that re-writing it through this definition
  was a separate branch**; that branch has happened, so the one instance either has is a test
  declaration — `ComplexAnalytic.lineRefineToBase` is this definition at ten arguments and
  `ComplexAnalytic.not_surjective_base_lineRefineToBase` spends the equivalence — and what is still
  absent is a consumer inside `Oka/`.
* **Nothing about `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumUnitFamGlueData`.** That same section names the
  morphism and not the gluing; that the space sits over that glue data is
  `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumUnitFamAnalytification_toLocallyRingedSpace`, which is stated where
  the space is and is quoted here rather than restated.
* **No `Spec` side, no scheme and no `admissible`**, as in the files this one sits beside.

/-! ### The condition -/

/-- **The refining family covers**: every point of every member of the original cover lies in a
refined member lying over that member.

**Per member and not per point of the glued space**, which is the design decision this file's
header argues: the members are glued along their overlaps, so a point of the `i`-th member can be
reached through a different member and the glued-space form is strictly weaker. What that weaker
form is equivalent to is `ComplexAnalytic.surjective_base_refineDatumToBase_iff`, and
**`ComplexAnalytic.dupStrict` is the datum at which the two come apart** — so *strictly* is proved
here and not asserted.

**`ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq` is why no transport appears.** `fam b` is a polynomial in the
variables of `obj (σ b)` and the point is in the `i`-th member, so the containment cannot be stated
without identifying the two members somewhere; `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumRange.lean` declares
that identification for exactly this problem. -/

/-- **The condition forces the index map to hit every index whose member has a point.**

This is the whole of what the per-member form asks beyond the glued-space one, and it is why
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOneCovers` takes `Function.Surjective σ`: a point of the `i`-th member
has to be reached through a refined member lying over `i` itself, and the glued-space form is free
to reach it through any member at all. `ComplexAnalytic.dupStrict` is the datum where that
difference is realised. -/

/-! ### The condition, read as a statement about the members alone

What `ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumCovers` gives before any morphism is mentioned. The lemma below
has exactly two consumers: `ComplexAnalytic.surjective_base_refineDatumToBase` under
`### Surjectivity`, and `ComplexAnalytic.iUnion_range_base_refineDatumMemberIota_eq_univ` in the
open-cover section, which is the same union in the vocabulary of a family of morphisms rather than
of a family of images. `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOneOpenCover` at the end of this file reaches
it through the second.
-/

/-- **The refining family covering makes the images of the refined members exhaust `X^an`.**

**No morphism down appears, and none is needed**: an arbitrary point of the gluing is in some
member by `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData.ι_jointly_surjective`, the hypothesis puts
it in a refined member over *that* member, and `ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq_self` discharges
the identification the hypothesis is stated across once `subst` has eliminated the index. So this
holds of every index map and every refining family meeting the condition, with no `q`, no choice
and none of the refined datum's three laws — which is what makes it available to
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOpenCover` below, where no refined datum has been built.

**Nothing under `### The image` takes the hypothesis**: everything there holds of every refinement,
and `ComplexAnalytic.surjective_base_refineDatumToBase` is this theorem and the image computation,
and has no argument of its own. -/

`congrArg (fun m ↦ m.toLRSHom.base w)` and nothing else — both `AnalyticSpace`'s composition and
`AnalyticSpace.Hom.toLRSHom` of it are definitional, so no rewrite is involved and none is
available: the equation is between morphisms of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`, and a `simp only`
naming `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.comp_base` does not fire on it because the composite
is not syntactically one of that category's.

**A declaration and not a `have` inside the theorem below**, because that theorem spends it once in

/-- **The morphism down is surjective when the refining family covers.**

The image above is everything, and that is
`ComplexAnalytic.iUnion_coverIota_image_localisationOpen_eq_univ` — where the hypothesis is spent
and where the argument is, none of it mentioning this morphism. **So this theorem is the image
computation and that lemma and has no content of its own**, which is the split this file's header
argues: the condition is about the members of the two covers, and the surjectivity of the
comparison is what it buys.

**This theorem's own hypothesis is spent entirely at that lemma**; nothing under `### The image`
takes it, so everything there holds of every refinement. -/

is `Set.range_eq_univ` at the image computation.

**This is the converse `ComplexAnalytic.surjective_base_refineDatumToBase` does not give, and the
difference is the point.** `ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumCovers` is a statement about each member of
the original cover; what
surjectivity is *equivalent* to is the same statement about the glued space, where a point of one
member may be reached through another. So the implication above is strict as stated — that is
`ComplexAnalytic.dupStrict`, and this equivalence is that theorem's first consumer — and this
equivalence is what a caller arguing in the other direction has. -/

`ComplexAnalytic.localisationOpen_one` makes `D(1)` the whole member, so nothing is left of the
containment and what remains is that some refined index lie over each original one. The
identification is along `rfl` after the surjectivity has been eliminated, so
`ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq_refl` closes it.

**This is what stops `ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumCovers` from being a condition with no instance**,
and it is the trivial end of it: `fam ≡ 1` refines nothing, as
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumWitness.lean` says of its own witness in terms, so nothing here is
evidence about a family that cuts a member down. -/

/-! ### The condition is strictly stronger, and the datum that shows it

Two copies of one presentation, glued along the whole of each. Every off-diagonal overlap is
`D(1)`, so each member is already the whole gluing and the second one is redundant; an index map
that misses it still gives a surjection and no longer meets the per-member condition.

**The two triple-overlap laws are vacuous here rather than proved.** A two-element index type has
no three pairwise distinct members, which is `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.hRange_of_no_three` and
`ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.hCocycle_of_no_three` — so nothing below is evidence that either law
holds of anything, and a reader should not take this datum as an instance of them. It is a datum
because they cannot be tested at this size, which is the honest reason and is the same one
`OkaTest/ProjectiveLine.lean` gives for its own two-member cover.

/-! ### The condition at an index map that is the identity, where it is one equation per member

At `σ = id` the refined family is indexed by the original cover's own index type and the
`∃ b, ∃ h : σ b = i` of the condition can only be answered by `i` itself, so
`ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq` is an identification of a member with itself and
`ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq_self` disposes of it. **What is left is that `D(fam i)` be the
whole of the `i`-th member**, and a refining family that cuts a member down is exactly a family
that fails that.

**That is a biconditional and it is proved here as one**,
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumCovers_id_iff`. The first draft of this section proved the forward
implication at five sites that read as an equivalence, which is the defect
`ComplexAnalytic.dupStrict` was written to retire one branch earlier and in this same file; the
converse costs one term and the sentences are now true rather than nearly true.

**`ComplexAnalytic.not_refineDatumCovers_id_of_ne_top` keeps its own name although the
equivalence subsumes it**, because it is the form `OkaTest/RefineDatumUnitFamily.lean` spends and
inlining it would put the negation step in a test file. The bullet for it above says so without
naming that file, since a backticked path under `## Main results` is read by
`scripts/guard_coverage.py` as a result this file advertises.

**The three statements below are quantified over `i` rather than proved at an index**, and that is
not a style choice. `ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumCovers` is stated across an identification of two
members, so at a concrete index `subst` has nothing to eliminate and
`rw [ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq_self]` fails on a goal reported as *"not type-correct under
the `instances` transparency level"* — the defect `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumRange.lean`
documents, measured again here. Substituting inside a lemma stated at a variable is what makes
these four lines, and it is the same ordering
`ComplexAnalytic.surjective_base_refineDatumToBase` above is written in.

**None of this is about surjectivity.** `ComplexAnalytic.dupStrict` says the condition is strictly
stronger than the surjectivity of the morphism down, so refuting it at a datum decides nothing
about that morphism at that datum, in either direction. A caller wanting surjectivity has
`ComplexAnalytic.surjective_base_refineDatumToBase_iff` and nothing here.

/-- **At an identity index map the condition puts every point of the `i`-th member in `D(fam i)`.**

The condition offers a `b` with `id b = i`, which is `i`, and a point of `D(fam b)` mapping to `y`
along the identification of the two; `subst` turns the first into `rfl` and
`ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq_self` turns the second into the identity, after which the point
offered *is* `y`. **The `rfl` pattern in the `obtain` is what does the work**: it lands the
identification's value in the goal rather than in a hypothesis, which is why nothing has to be
rewritten in the other direction. -/

/-- **So at an identity index map each refined member is the whole of the member it lies over.**

`eq_top_iff` at the theorem above. This is the form in which the condition is a statement about the
*family* rather than about points, and it is what makes the contrapositive below one line. -/
theorem localisationOpen_eq_top_of_refineDatumCovers_id
    (h : RefineDatumCovers.{u} obj id fam) (i : J) :
    localisationOpen.{u} (obj i).g (fam i) = ⊤ :=
  eq_top_iff.2 fun y _ ↦ mem_localisationOpen_of_refineDatumCovers_id.{u} obj fam h i y

/-- **One member whose `D(fam i)` is a proper open refutes the condition**, at an identity index
map.

The contrapositive of the theorem above, and the form an instance spends: a refinement is a
refinement precisely when some `D(fam i)` is not the whole member, so at `σ = id` a refinement that
refines cannot meet `ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumCovers`. **That is a fact about the condition and
not about the refinement's morphism down**, for the reason the section header gives. -/
theorem not_refineDatumCovers_id_of_ne_top (i : J)
    (hne : localisationOpen.{u} (obj i).g (fam i) ≠ ⊤) :
    ¬ RefineDatumCovers.{u} obj id fam :=
  fun h ↦ hne (localisationOpen_eq_top_of_refineDatumCovers_id.{u} obj fam h i)

/-- **And conversely: if every `D(fam i)` is the whole member, the condition holds** at an identity
index map.

A term and not a tactic proof, which is the point of writing it this way. The witness is `i`
itself, the identification is along `rfl`, and the last component is
`ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq_refl` read at a point through `congrArg`.

**The two obvious tactic steps both fail, and they fail for the reason the section header gives.**
`rw [h i]` does not match a goal reading `y ∈ localisationOpen (obj (id i)).g (fam i)`, because
`id i` is not syntactically `i`; and `rw [coverSpaceHomOfEq_self]` does not match either, because
the stored proof has type `id i = i` while the pattern wants `?i = ?i` — the same *"not type-correct
under the `instances` transparency level"* report the forward direction met, in a shape where
nothing is available to `subst`. **A term application unifies at default transparency and neither
step arises**, which is `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumRange.lean`'s own prescription — the bridge
is `rfl`, so state it with the type written out and let `congrArg` carry it. -/
theorem refineDatumCovers_id_of_forall_eq_top
    (h : ∀ i : J, localisationOpen.{u} (obj i).g (fam i) = ⊤) :
    RefineDatumCovers.{u} obj id fam := fun i y ↦
  ⟨i, rfl, y, (h i).ge trivial,
    congrArg (fun m : coverSpace.{u} obj i ⟶ coverSpace.{u} obj i ↦
      (ConcreteCategory.hom m.base) y) (coverSpaceHomOfEq_refl.{u} obj i)⟩

/-- **So at an identity index map the condition *is* the equation**, and not merely implies it.

The two directions above joined. **This is what the prose of this section says and what its first
draft did not prove**: five sentences read as a biconditional where only `→` was available, which is
the same species as the assertions `ComplexAnalytic.dupStrict` retired one branch earlier in this
file. -/

/-! ### The instance at a family that is a unit on each overlap

`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumUnitFamily.lean` builds the refined cover datum at an injective
index map and a family that is a unit on each overlap, and stops at its glue data and its space:
**it does not name the morphism down**, because that morphism is
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumToBase` and this file, not that one, is where the trivial family's
counterpart already lives. `ComplexAnalytic.surjective_base_refineDatumOneToBase` is that
counterpart and it is under this file's `### The instance at the trivial refining family`.

**Named and not located**, and deliberately. Every sentence in this section that points at another
part of this file **names its heading** rather than counting positions, so a section appended past
or reordered cannot falsify this paragraph silently and a heading renamed leaves a citation a
`grep` can find. Counting was the defect this subtree has spent several branches on, and the
sentences above were written the counting way first.

**The type of `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumUnitFamToBase` is the whole point of naming it.** Its
source is written as `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumUnitFamAnalytification` rather than as the
fifteen arguments that definition unfolds to, so the morphism is tied to the space a caller has a
name for; the two are the same term, because that definition **is**
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumAnalytificationOfLaws` at exactly these arguments, and no bridge is
needed. Its target is `ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification`, which is the cover it refines.

**The equivalence is what pays for the filing.** Without
`ComplexAnalytic.surjective_base_refineDatumUnitFamToBase_iff` a caller asking whether a proper
refinement covers has to spell fifteen arguments to state the question, and the first instance to
ask it did exactly that until this was named. `OkaTest/RefineDatumUnitFamily.lean`'s
`ComplexAnalytic.not_surjective_base_lineRefineToBase` now asks it at ten placeholders instead, and
proves the same statement — which is the measurement the readability claim was owed.

/-! ### The refined members as an open cover of the space they refine

The two things the `## What is not here` bullet above priced — a choice of index for each point,
and an open-immersion statement for the composite — and the definition they assemble into. What
makes them cheap is that **neither of them, and nothing in this section's first five declarations,
reads the refined datum at all**: the composite below is built from `σ` and the refining family,
and the cross-member choices `q`, `rr` and `uu` appear only where the morphism down does.

/-- **The `b`-th refined member, sitting in the space the refinement refines**: its projection
down to the member it lies over, followed by that member's inclusion.

**No refined datum appears in it.** `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumToBase` needs the cross-member
choices and all three of the refined datum's laws before it can be written down; this composite
needs an index map and a refining family, and the equation tying the two together is
`ComplexAnalytic.coverIota_comp_refineDatumToBase`, which is where the datum re-enters and is
quoted below rather than restated. So everything through
`ComplexAnalytic.iUnion_range_base_refineDatumMemberIota_eq_univ` is a statement about a family of
opens of `X^an` and not about a second analytic space, and the open cover assembled from them
stands whether or not that second space has been built.

Named for `ComplexAnalytic.coverIota`, which it is the refined counterpart of: the original
datum's `i`-th member is included by `coverIota i`, and the `b`-th refined member by this. -/

`ComplexAnalytic.isOpenImmersion_coverIota` — and Mathlib composes them. **The
`inferInstanceAs` is the seam `Oka/Geometry/RingedSpace/OpenImmersion.lean` documents**, not a
tactic reached for after something failed: the goal is headed by

`ComplexAnalytic.range_base_localisationProj`, the **equality**, and `Set.range_comp`. This is the
second place on this line that needs the equality rather than
`ComplexAnalytic.range_base_localisationProj_subset`, and for the same reason as the first: the
containment would give one inclusion of the two sets and the image has to be produced. -/

and for the reason this file exists to make measurable: the condition is *strictly* stronger by
`ComplexAnalytic.dupStrict`, so a cover asked at it would be unavailable at exactly the data the
weaker form admits. `ComplexAnalytic.iUnion_range_base_refineDatumMemberIota_eq_univ` is the
condition's implication and `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOneOpenCover` spends it.

**`idx` is a choice and nothing downstream depends on which**, as in
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData.openCover` and
`ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytificationOpenCover`, which is why this is `noncomputable`. The
`covers` field is `Set.mem_iUnion` applied to the hypothesis and then the same
`Exists.choose_spec`; the two fields are written from one term rather than one being derived from
the other, because a `Prop`-valued field cannot see the `Exists.choose` a data-valued one made
unless it is spelled again.

/-- **The refined members as an open cover of the space they glue to** — the direction this file's
`## What is not here` kept on recording as absent beside the one it retired.

`ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytificationOpenCover` at the refined datum, and **nothing is built
here**: a refinement's `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumObj`, `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumPoly` and
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlue` are a cover datum, its three laws are the ones
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumToBase` already passes, and the general cover's own open cover applies
to it with no transport. The type is stated against
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumAnalytificationOfLaws` rather than against the
`ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification` that definition unfolds to, so that a caller reads the space
this line is about.

**This costs the hypotheses the cover of `X^an` above does not.**
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOpenCover` covers `X^an` by opens of the original members and reads no
refined datum at all, which is why it is available at data for which the cross-member equations
have not been discharged; this one is a cover of the glued refined space and so needs the whole
datum. **They are different statements about
different spaces and neither is the other's corollary** — what relates them is the factorisation
below. -/

`ComplexAnalytic.range_base_refineDatumToBase_eq_iUnion_range` says the *image* of the morphism
down is the union of the ranges of `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOpenCover`'s maps; this says the
maps themselves factor, which is strictly more and is what a consumer of the two covers wants.
**The hypothesis is still the ranges covering and not `ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumCovers`**, for
the reason the definition above it gives, and it is used only to have a cover of `X^an` to state
the equation against — the factorisation itself is the theorem above and takes no hypothesis at
all. -/
