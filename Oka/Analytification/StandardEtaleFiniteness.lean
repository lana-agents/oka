# The analytification of a standard étale morphism is finite over an open subset of the base

`Oka/Analytification/OpenBaseFiniteness.lean` makes the hypersurface `{F = 0}` finite over every
open `V ⊆ ℂ^n`, and says in terms that the step it does **not** take is the one that would make
that hypersurface the analytification of a *localised* algebra:

> Identifying the source of this theorem with the analytification of a *localised* algebra is the
> step `ComplexAnalytic.etaleAnalytificationIso` would be spent on, and it is not taken.

This file takes it. Over `V ⊆ (ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfaceCommonZeroImage F G)ᶜ` the part of the
hypersurface lying above `V` is already inside `D(G)`, so the standard étale analytification —
which `ComplexAnalytic.etaleAnalytificationIso` identifies with `D(G)` inside that hypersurface,
**over the base** — has the same part above `V`, and the finiteness transports.

Together with `Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleLocalIso.lean`, which is the local-isomorphism
half, this is the whole of taxis #1112's §1 at `k = 0`.

## The route

Three steps, and only the middle one is about `F` and `G` at all.

* **The hypersurface, in the presentation spelling.**
  `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_analytification_comp_projRestrict` is stated for the family
  `![(lastVarPolyEquiv n).symm F]` and as `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictHom` of the
  inclusion followed by `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.projRestrict`; the comparison is stated for
  `ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfacePresentation` and wants the restriction of a single composite.
  `ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfacePresentation_empty` bridges the families and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictHom_comp` bridges the two shapes — the projection over
  `V` **is** the projection restricted, `ComplexAnalytic.cylinder V` being the preimage of `V` by
  definition, so no content crosses here.
* **The containment**, which is the geometry: above a `V` avoiding the bad set, `G` vanishes at no
  point of the hypersurface. That is
  `ComplexAnalytic.eval_ne_zero_of_notMem_hypersurfaceCommonZeroImage` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.mem_localisationOpen_iff`, and it is one line because both are quantified over
  *points* and neither crosses an `AnalyticSpace.restrict`.
* **The transport.** `ComplexAnalytic.etaleAnalytificationIso_hom_comp` factors the étale
  projection as the isomorphism, the inclusion of `D(G)`, and the hypersurface's own projection —
  the same factorisation `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp` uses,
  regrouped so that the first two are one morphism. Restricting that composite over `V` splits it
  by `restrictHom_comp`, and the first factor is finite by
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_restrictHom_of_subset_range`.

## What the two obstacles on record turned out to be

Taxis #1448 sized this item and named two obstacles; both were measured, and what the proof needed
was neither of them.

* **The spelling bridge is real and is here**, as `ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfacePresentation_empty`
  in `Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleAnalytification.lean`.
* **The `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFinite` transport along an isomorphism was recorded as
  missing, and it is not missing**: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_comp` is an
  **instance** and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_isIso` is beside it, so
  `IsFinite p → IsFinite (e.hom ≫ p)` is `haveI := isFinite_of_isIso e.hom; infer_instance`. The
  `exact?` that reported *"could not close the goal"* on
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Finite.lean` was asking for a lemma, and the fact is carried by instance
  search instead.
* **And that transport is not the step this file takes**, which is the part worth keeping. The
  composite whose finiteness is wanted is the **restriction over `V`**, and the unrestricted one
  is not finite at all — that is taxis #1112's counterexample. What is needed is that *restricting
  an open immersion over an open subset of its image is finite*, which is a statement about `V`
  and not about the morphism, and which
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_restrictHom_of_subset_range` now carries. An
  isomorphism appears in the proof only because the open immersion here is
  `etaleAnalytificationIso` followed by the inclusion of `D(G)`; it contributes an embedding and a
  surjection and nothing else.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_restrictHom_hypersurface_comp_proj`: the hypersurface of `ℂ^(n+1)`,
  read as the analytification of `ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfacePresentation` at an empty base
  presentation, is **finite over every open subset of `ℂ^n`**. This is
  `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_analytification_comp_projRestrict` in the spelling the comparison
  uses, and no geometry is added to it.
- `ComplexAnalytic.map_le_localisationOpen_of_subset_compl`: **above a `V` avoiding the bad set
  the hypersurface is contained in `D(G)`.** The geometric content, at the level of opens.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp`: **the
  analytification of a standard étale morphism, restricted over an open subset of `ℂ^n` on which
  the inversion is vacuous, is finite over that subset.** The theorem the file is for.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp_compl`: the same at
  the largest such subset, the complement of `ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfaceCommonZeroImage`, which
  is open by `ComplexAnalytic.isClosed_hypersurfaceCommonZeroImage`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp_parabola`: **and the
  same at a pair for which that subset is proper and nonempty**, which is the only case the two
  theorems this instance specialises —
  `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp_compl` — are
  interesting in, and the first instance of it on this line.

## What is not here

* **No `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale` *here*, and the lemma this bullet said was
  missing now exists.** It ended *"nothing in the repository transports it — measured, not read:
  no statement anywhere has `IsLocalIso` applied to a `restrictHom`"*, and the sizing was right:
  the transport is a general fact about open subspaces with nothing étale in it, and it is
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_restrictHom`
  (`Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenSubspace.lean`), which asks nothing of the morphism and nothing of the
  open. The class itself is
  `ComplexAnalytic.isFiniteEtale_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp`
  (`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleFiniteEtale.lean`), whose first field is the theorem below
  verbatim. **It is not here, and that is a placement decision rather than an absence**: the
  bullet below says this file reads no `StandardEtalePair`, and the class does read one.

  **The unrestricted `IsFiniteEtale` stays false forever** and nothing here bears on it:
  `Oka/Analytification/MonicHypersurface.lean` carries the counterexample in terms and
  `ComplexAnalytic.not_isFiniteEtale_condEtaleProj` (`OkaTest/StandardEtaleNotFinite.lean`)
  compiles it, since 2026-09-02; nothing below narrows either. A **different and broader**
  absence — *the analytification of a finite étale
  morphism of schemes*, the other blocker of the Riemann existence theorem — is what
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalIso.lean`, `Oka/AnalyticSpace/CoveringMap.lean` and
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SigmaFiniteEtale.lean` record, in those words. Nothing below narrows that
  either: everything here is one standard étale presentation over `ℂ^n`, and the general morphism
  is a Zariski-local gluing that nothing starts.
* **Nothing at `k ≥ 1`.** Everything is at an empty base presentation, for the reason
  `Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleLocalIso.lean` gives for its own restriction: the two sides
  meet only over `ℂ^n`. `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_analytification_comp_projRestrict`'s base is
  `ℂ^n` and `ComplexAnalytic.etaleAnalytificationIso`'s is `A^an`, and a statement over a
  presented base is a different theorem rather than a missing hypothesis. **That different theorem
  now exists for the local-isomorphism half and not for this one**:
  `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_analytificationMap_etalePresHom`
  (`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleLocalIsoBase.lean`) is about the structure map to `X^an`, and
  nothing on the finiteness line has moved.
* **No `StandardEtalePair`, and no `StandardEtalePair.cond` is read** — by any theorem below,
  including the instance. **Every theorem below except the instance holds for every monic `F` and
  every `G`** — `G` is read only through the bad set — so nothing here says the source is étale,
  only that it is the analytification of the presentation
  `ComplexAnalytic.etalePresentation` names. That is the same stance
  `ComplexAnalytic.etaleAnalytificationIso` takes, and it is a weaker hypothesis than
  `Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleLocalIso.lean`'s last two theorems take.

  **This bullet used to say "the theorems below" where it meant the general ones**, and
  `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp_parabola` is at one
  `F` and one `G`, so the quantifier had to be scoped rather than left to be read charitably. **The
  stance is unweakened**: an instance narrows what is *quantified over* and not what is *asked
  of* the pair, and the instance asks no more than monicity — which is why it can sit in this file
  at all, where `Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleFiniteEtale.lean` could not.

  **The first scoping of it said "the two general theorems" and there are four** — the `## Main
  results` list above names all four before it names the instance. That is worth a sentence rather
  than a silent correction, because of *how* it happened: the sentence being repaired was a
  **universal**, which is falsified by one counterexample, and scoping a universal turns it into a
  **count**, which is falsified only by enumerating. The repair created a claim nobody had to
  check before it existed. **After scoping a universal, count.** This bullet now says *every
  theorem below except the instance*, which is the same statement with no arithmetic in it.
* **No isomorphism of restricted spaces**, and the containment is not turned into one. Finiteness
  needs a closed embedding and no more, which is what
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_restrictHom_of_subset_range` supplies. The restricted
  morphism is in fact **bijective** on points — `ComplexAnalytic.surjective_base_restrictHom` is
  the surjective half and the embedding is the other — so the two restricted spaces are
  homeomorphic; promoting that to an isomorphism of *analytic* spaces needs an inverse morphism
  together with its `ℂ`-linearity, and nothing here builds one.
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenSubspace.lean`'s `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftRestrict` is the
  construction that would, and it is not called.
* **Nothing about how large `V` is**, and that is a hypothesis on the pair `(F, G)` rather than a
  theorem. `Oka/Analytification/OpenBaseFiniteness.lean` bounds it from both ends —
  `ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfaceCommonZeroImage_one` makes the bad set empty at `G = 1`, so `V` may
  be all of `ℂ^n`, and `ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfaceCommonZeroImage_X` makes it everything, so `V`
  may be empty and the theorem below say nothing. **This bullet said "No pair is exhibited
  anywhere for which `V` is proper *and* nonempty", and one now is**:
  `ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfaceCommonZeroImage_parabola` makes the bad set a coordinate hyperplane
  at `F = X² - x_i`, `G = X`, and the theorem below is instantiated there as
  `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp_parabola`. So the
  quantification is no longer empty of content in the only case it is interesting in. **What is
  still not here is any *general* statement about the size of `V`** — it remains a hypothesis on
  the pair and not a theorem, and `OkaTest/OpenBaseFiniteness.lean` exhibits a non-degenerate pair
  at which `V` is empty. Read this file as the transport of a finiteness across
  `ComplexAnalytic.etaleAnalytificationIso`, and read `OkaTest/OpenBaseFiniteness.lean` for what
  such a statement buys.
* **No stalks, no germs and no derivative.** The local-isomorphism half is
  `Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleLocalIso.lean` and nothing here is evidence about it.

/-! ### The hypersurface over `V`, in the presentation spelling -/

/-- **The hypersurface `{F = 0} ⊆ ℂ^(n+1)`, read as the analytification of
`ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfacePresentation` at an empty base presentation, is finite over every
open subset of `ℂ^n`.**

`ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_analytification_comp_projRestrict` and nothing else. Two spellings are
changed and neither carries content:

* the family — `ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfacePresentation_empty`, which is not `rfl` and is why
  that lemma exists;
* the shape — `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictHom_comp`, which splits the restriction of
  `incl ≫ proj` over `V` into the restriction of `incl` over `ComplexAnalytic.cylinder V` followed
  by `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.projRestrict V`. Both of those are definitional —
  `ComplexAnalytic.cylinder` **is** the preimage of `V` under the projection and `projRestrict`
  **is** `restrictHom` of the projection — so the lemma is doing the association and nothing more.

**The `rw` on the family is available here and is not available everywhere**: the presentation
occurs only as an argument to `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.analytification` and to
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationInclHom`, and `V` does not mention it, so the motive is a function
of the family and `rw` builds it. -/

/-! ### The containment, which is the geometry -/

/-- **Above an open subset of the base avoiding the bad set, the hypersurface lies inside
`D(G)`.**

This is the statement `Oka/Analytification/OpenBaseFiniteness.lean` calls *the vacuity of the
inversion*, moved from points to opens, and it is the one place where `G` does anything.

`ComplexAnalytic.eval_ne_zero_of_notMem_hypersurfaceCommonZeroImage` says exactly that `G` does
not vanish at a point of the hypersurface whose projection avoids the bad set, and
`ComplexAnalytic.mem_localisationOpen_iff` says that not vanishing **is** membership of `D(G)`. So
the proof is those two and the hypothesis, with nothing between them.

**It crosses no `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrict`, and that is why it is one line.** The
hazard `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_analytification_comp_projRestrict` records at its own range
step — that a goal mentioning a restricted space is not type-correct at `instances` transparency,
so `rw` fails on a pattern that is visibly present — does not fire here: both facts quoted are
quantified over points of the *unrestricted* analytification, and an inequality of opens is
settled point by point. -/

/-! ### The finiteness of the standard étale analytification over `V` -/

/-- **The analytification of a standard étale morphism over `ℂ^n`, restricted over an open subset
of the base on which the inversion is vacuous, is finite over that subset.**

The theorem taxis #1112's §1 is named for, and the one place in the development where
`ComplexAnalytic.etaleAnalytificationIso` is spent on a *finiteness*.

**Read the hypothesis first.** `V` is any open subset of `ℂ^n` disjoint from
`ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfaceCommonZeroImage F G` — the image of the points of `{F = 0}` at which
`G` also vanishes. Above such a `V` there is nothing to invert, which is what makes the étale
analytification and the hypersurface agree there.

**The hypothesis is not decoration: there are pairs and `V` meeting the bad set at which the
conclusion fails.** At `F = X² - x` and `G = X` the bad set is the origin of the line, so `V = ⊤`
meets it, and inverting `G` cuts the point `(0, 0)` out of the parabola; the projection of what is
left has the punctured line for image, which is not closed, so the morphism is not finite.
`Oka/Analytification/MonicHypersurface.lean` carries that computation in terms. **This paragraph
said *"it is not compiled anywhere in this repository"* until 2026-09-02, and it now is**:
`ComplexAnalytic.not_isFinite_condEtaleProj` and
`ComplexAnalytic.not_isFiniteEtale_condEtaleProj` (`OkaTest/StandardEtaleNotFinite.lean`), at
exactly this pair — `ComplexAnalytic.condPair`, which is `f = X² - C z₀`, `g = X` over the empty
presentation of the line.

**What is compiled is the conclusion and not the computation above.** That file proves the
morphism misses **one** point of the base, the origin, and reads the rest off
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.not_isFinite_of_isLocalIso_of_not_surjective`
(`Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalIso.lean`): a local isomorphism has open image, a finite morphism has
closed image, and the line is connected, so a non-empty source and one missing point are enough.
**The image is not computed there and nothing says it is the punctured line** — that is a
strictly stronger statement needing a square root of every non-zero complex number, and this
sentence's *"has the punctured line for image"* remains uncompiled. What was uncompiled and is no
longer is *"so the morphism is not finite"*.

**Nothing here says the `hV` hypothesis is irredundant**, and that is a third statement again:
this theorem is about `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictHom` of the composite and the
counterexample is about the composite itself, and nothing in this repository relates the two at
`V = ⊤`.

**This sentence used to end by generalising that witness, and the generalisation is false.** It
read *"over a `V` meeting the bad set the conclusion is **false**"*, which as a universal claims
failure at every pair and every such `V`. `ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfaceCommonZeroImage_sqSubOnePair`
(`OkaTest/OpenBaseFiniteness.lean`) proves the bad set is **all of `ℂ^n`** at `F = X² - 1`,
`G = X - 1`, so every non-empty `V` there meets it — and there the inversion removes an entire
connected component of `{X² = 1}` rather than a point of one, leaving the single sheet `{X = -1}`,
a graph over the base with no reason for finiteness to fail. **That is the distinction the old
sentence collapsed**: what breaks finiteness is not that the bad set is met but that the inversion
punctures a component, and meeting the bad set does not say which of the two happens.

**Three claims have just been made and exactly one of them is a theorem here, so read them
apart.** *(i)* The bad set is everything at `ComplexAnalytic.sqSubOnePair` — **proved**,
`ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfaceCommonZeroImage_sqSubOnePair`. *(ii)* The restricted morphism is
finite there — **not proved, in either direction, and nothing below states it**; it is a reading
of the geometry. *(iii)* The puncture-versus-component criterion of the previous paragraph — **not
proved either, and it is a universal over every pair, so it is the strongest thing here and the
least supported.** The criterion is where the geometry says finiteness ought to live: the piece
kept is open in a hypersurface that is finite over the base, and an open subspace of that is
finite exactly when it is also closed, which is to say a union of components. **That argument is
not carried out anywhere in this repository.**

So this paragraph claims that the sentence it retires was **unsupported**, not that its negation
is established, and it offers *(iii)* as the shape of what a proof would look like rather than as
one.

The proof is the factorisation `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp`
uses, regrouped. `ComplexAnalytic.etaleAnalytificationIso_hom_comp` and
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationMap_hypersurfacePresHom_comp` write the étale projection as

    (iso ≫ inclusion of D(G)) ≫ (inclusion of the hypersurface ≫ projection to ℂ^n)

and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictHom_comp` restricts the two factors separately. The
second is the theorem above. The first is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_restrictHom_of_subset_range`, whose two hypotheses are
where the isomorphism and the containment are spent: an isomorphism of analytic spaces followed by
an open immersion is an **embedding** on bases, and its **range is `D(G)`**, which the containment
puts the relevant open inside of. Both come from the one homeomorphism
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.homeoOfIso` produces from the isomorphism — the embedding
from its being one, the range from its being surjective.

**`AnalyticSpace.isFinite_comp` is applied by name rather than by `infer_instance`**, and that is
not decoration: the two facts are `have`s about `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictHom` at
opens which the goal spells through `Opens.map`, and instance search does not close the goal from
them even as `haveI`s — measured, *"failed to synthesize instance"* on the first factor. Naming
the instance and passing both explicitly is what makes the composite go through. -/

`ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp` and
`ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp_compl`.

`ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp_compl` at
`F = X² - x_i`, `G = X`, with `ComplexAnalytic.monic_X_sq_sub_C` as its monicity;
`ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfaceCommonZeroImage_parabola` computes the bad set as
`{w | w i = 0}` and `ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfaceCommonZeroImage_parabola_nonempty` and
`ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfaceCommonZeroImage_parabola_ne_univ` are what say the complement is
neither empty nor everything.

**Necessary and satisfiable are two readings of the same properness, and that is why this pair and
not another.** The hypothesis is *delete the bad set*, so a bad set that is proper and nonempty is
exactly what makes the deletion both necessary and non-destructive: a pair with an empty bad set
needs no hypothesis, and one with a full bad set leaves nothing behind. **This is the same pair
`Oka/Analytification/MonicHypersurface.lean` uses to show the *unrestricted* statement is false**,
and the coincidence is not one.

**The clause above used to read "the only case *either theorem above* is interesting in", and four
theorems are above it.** *Either* picks two of the four and does not say which, so the reading on
which the sentence is true — the two named, the ones this instance specialises — had to be
supplied by the reader, while the reading that ranges over all four is false:
`ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_restrictHom_hypersurface_comp_proj` has no bad set in it at all and is
finiteness over **every** open of `ℂ^n`, `⊤` included. **That is a third way a numeral in a
docstring goes wrong here and it is neither of the two this file has already met**: it was not
stale, since nothing added above it made it false, and it was not wrong when written, since under
the intended scoping it was true then and is true now. It was **underdetermined**, and the two
habits that catch the other two — recount after a change, and read the sentence against the file
it describes — both pass it, because the arithmetic is not what is wrong. The repair is a name
and not a number. -/
