# A section over a member of the glued `Spec` is a polynomial in that member's variables

`Oka/Analytification/SpecScheme.lean` glues the spectra of the algebras a cover datum presents
into a scheme `X`, exhibits each member as an affine open
(`ComplexAnalytic.isAffineOpen_specSchemeIota`), and ends with
`ComplexAnalytic.exists_basicOpen_specSchemeIota_inter`: every point of the overlap of two members
lies in an open distinguished in both. `Oka/Analytification/SpecTwoData.lean` carries the members
of a *second* cover datum into the same scheme along a morphism `Φ` of what the two glue and ends
with the same statement across the two data. **Both produce sections, and a cover datum is not
written in sections.** Its `poly i j` is a polynomial in the member's own variables, and the gap
between the two vocabularies is what this file closes, at one datum and at two.

**`ComplexAnalytic.exists_mvPolynomial_basicOpen_specSchemeIota_inter` is the first declaration in
this repository whose proof term reads `ComplexAnalytic.exists_basicOpen_specSchemeIota_inter`**,
and **two** files recorded that theorem as having none:
`Oka/Analytification/SpecAffineCover.lean`'s *"which no declaration consumes yet"* and
`Oka/Analytification/SpecTwoData.lean`'s *"That theorem still has none"*. **The commit that adds
this file repairs both.** An earlier head of it said the first was *the only* such site; that was
true when it was written and stopped being true when lana-agents/oka#371 landed the second while
this branch was in review. **A claim about the whole tree, made from a branch, is falsified by
whatever lands next, and this one was.**

The sweep is a `grep` and not a reading, so the pattern rather than the adjective: `grep -rniE`
over `Oka/` and `OkaTest/` for *no declaration consumes*, *nothing consumes*, *has no consumer*
and *no consumer of*. Its other hits are `Oka/Analytic/DividedDifference.lean` and
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimpleZeroStalk.lean`, about other objects, and
`Oka/Analytification/CoverIndependence.lean`'s *"Nothing consumes it yet"*, which is about
naturality of the cover-datum isomorphism. **Being its consumer is not being what asked for it**:
what the repaired clauses are about is a common refinement, and the theorems below restate the
local form rather than assembling one.

The bridge is `AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion.specΓIsoTop`
(`Oka/AlgebraicGeometry/OpenImmersion.lean`, a mirror-tree file with no analytic content):
sections of `𝒪_X` over the range of an open immersion out of `Spec` of a presented algebra are
that algebra, which is `ComplexAnalytic.PresentedAlgebra` and so a quotient of a polynomial ring
by `abbrev`. One application of `Ideal.Quotient.mk_surjective` turns an element of it into a
polynomial. **Nothing below turns on how routine that step is elsewhere in the tree, and the three
attempts to say so by counting disagree**: taxis #1513 priced it at *"fifteen sites"*, taxis #1521
corrected that to *"29 sites in 18 files"*, and re-running the grep at `master` = `bbc30d6` gave
**28 in 17**. No two agree and nothing checks any of them, which is why the claim this paragraph
makes is that the step is *one application* — a fact about the declarations below and not a census
of the repository.

## The immersion is the argument, and that is what makes the two-datum statement sayable

`ComplexAnalytic.presentationSection` takes an **arbitrary** open immersion
`f : Spec (CommRingCat.of P.alg) ⟶ X` out of a presentation's spectrum, and the three theorems
about it are stated there rather than at a member of a cover datum. That is not generality for its
own sake and it was not the first shape this file had. **A member of the second datum, carried
into the first datum's scheme, is `ComplexAnalytic.specSchemeIotaMap` and is not
`ComplexAnalytic.specSchemeIota` of anything in the first datum**, so a lemma stated only at
`specSchemeIota` reaches one of the two sides of the cross-datum statement and not the other.
Stated at the immersion, one name spells both sides.

An earlier head of this file stated the three at `ComplexAnalytic.specSchemeIota` and declined the
cross-datum theorem, pricing it at *"the same two `obtain`s"* as the one-datum form. **That price
was wrong for exactly this reason** — the second lift had no lemma to be an `obtain` at, and the
second side of the conclusion had no name — and it was found by compiling the sentence rather than
by reading it (lana-agents/oka#374, `oka-slot-2-ea`). With the general form the price is right:
the last two theorems below are two lifts and an `exact`, the same shape as the one-datum theorem
above them. **The sentence became true by a change to the library and not by a change to the
sentence**, which is the only repair of a price that is worth more than deleting it.

`ComplexAnalytic.specSchemeIotaSection` survives as the one-datum spelling, defined as the general
form at `ComplexAnalytic.specSchemeIota`, because the immersion carries six arguments of cover
datum in front of the index and every one-datum statement would spell them twice without it. It is
a specialisation and not a second definition: the three theorems about it are the general ones
applied, with no proof of their own.

## Which open the statement is about, and it is a theorem here rather than a decision

`X.basicOpen f` for a section `f` is an open of the **glued scheme**; what a cover datum's
`poly i j` cuts out is an open of the **member**, `Spec` of that member's algebra. A statement in
polynomials has to say which of the two it means, and the two descriptions are not interchangeable
by fiat. `ComplexAnalytic.basicOpen_presentationSection` says they agree: the distinguished open
of `ComplexAnalytic.presentationSection f p` in `X` **is** the image under `f` of `D(p)` in the
member. So the statements below are about opens of `X` — which is what
`ComplexAnalytic.exists_basicOpen_specSchemeIota_inter` and
`ComplexAnalytic.exists_index_basicOpen_specSchemeIotaMap` are already about, so nothing had to be
restated — and the member-side reading is available from the same theorem read backwards.

## Why a module of its own

Three facts, and only the last one is now load-bearing.

* **`Oka/Analytification/SpecScheme.lean` was being edited by lana-agents/oka#371 when this file
  was written**, in the module-docstring paragraphs a `## Main results` entry here would sit
  between. Nothing here needed any part of that edit, so a new module bought a merge with no
  conflict for the price of one import line. **That branch has since landed and this reason is
  spent.**
* **Folding this back into `Oka/Analytification/SpecScheme.lean` is no longer a move and a
  deletion**, which is what an earlier head of this file said it was. The last two theorems below
  are about two cover data, so they read `ComplexAnalytic.specSchemeIotaMap` and this module now
  imports `Oka/Analytification/SpecTwoData.lean`; `Oka/Analytification/SpecScheme.lean` is
  upstream of that file and cannot state them. **Folding back is available for the first four
  declarations only, and would split the file.**
* The subject is different. Those files' subjects are *the members are affine opens* and *the
  members of a second datum are affine opens of the first's scheme*; this one's is *what a section
  over a member is*, which is the vocabulary a common refinement is stated in and not a fact about
  the covers.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.presentationSection`: the section of `𝒪_X` over the range of an open immersion
  out of a presented algebra's spectrum, attached to a polynomial in that presentation's
  variables.
- `ComplexAnalytic.specSchemeIotaSection`: that at `ComplexAnalytic.specSchemeIota`, the section
  over the `i`-th member's range.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.surjective_presentationSection`: **every section over the range comes from a
  polynomial in the presentation's variables**, and
  `ComplexAnalytic.surjective_specSchemeIotaSection` is that at a member of a cover datum.
- `ComplexAnalytic.basicOpen_presentationSection`: **the open it cuts out in `X` is the image of
  `D(p)`**, with `ComplexAnalytic.basicOpen_specSchemeIotaSection` the same at a member.
- `ComplexAnalytic.exists_mvPolynomial_basicOpen_specSchemeIota_inter`: **the polynomial form of
  `ComplexAnalytic.exists_basicOpen_specSchemeIota_inter`** — every point of the overlap of two
  members lies in an open cut out by a polynomial in either member's variables.
- `ComplexAnalytic.exists_mvPolynomial_basicOpen_specSchemeIotaMap_inter`: **the same across two
  cover data**, at a member of each.
- `ComplexAnalytic.exists_index_mvPolynomial_basicOpen_specSchemeIotaMap`: **the polynomial form
  of `ComplexAnalytic.exists_index_basicOpen_specSchemeIotaMap`** — at every point of the first
  datum's scheme there are a member of each datum and polynomials in their own variables cutting
  out the same open through the point, with no index handed in.

## What is not here

* **No common refinement**, and no part of one. There is no choice function, no refined family and
  none of a cover datum's three laws; `Oka/Analytification/SpecScheme.lean` names those three
  pieces and this file adds to none of them. What it adds is the vocabulary they would be stated
  in. **The last theorem below is the second piece pointwise** — a statement at every point,
  across two data, in polynomials — **and it is an existential rather than a choice, which is
  what keeps this file clear of that piece.** This bullet said it was *"the closest this
  repository comes"* to the second piece; that is no longer true of the repository, only of this
  file. `ComplexAnalytic.exists_family_mvPolynomial_basicOpen_specSchemeIotaMap`
  (`Oka/Analytification/SpecMemberChoice.lean`) takes the word *choice*, in one `choose` on the
  theorem below and nothing else, and the second piece is therefore no longer anywhere absent.
* **Nothing that constructs `Φ`**, and nothing that says two cover data with isomorphic gluings
  have anything else in common. `Oka/Analytification/SpecTwoData.lean` says the same of itself and
  the last two theorems here inherit its hypotheses unchanged: an open immersion for the fixed-index
  form, an isomorphism for the one that produces its indices.
* **Nothing about `ComplexAnalytic.coverOverlap` or `poly`.** The polynomials produced below are
  existential and are not claimed to be the cover datum's own `poly i j`, nor related to it. That
  they could be chosen to agree is a different statement and nothing here bears on it.
* **Nothing on the analytic side.** No analytification, no comparison morphism, and no statement
  about `X^an`.

**One instrument fact this file paid for and is worth keeping now that it no longer applies.**
While `Oka/Analytification/SpecTwoData.lean` was unmerged, a `## What is not here` bullet here
cited `ComplexAnalytic.exists_index_basicOpen_specSchemeIotaMap` and deliberately did not backtick
it: the name resolved to nothing, and `scripts/check_docstring_names.py` reports a forward
reference to an unmerged declaration rather than passing it — which it did to a first draft.
**A backticked *path* is checked by nothing in either state**, for the opposite reason: the checker
skips any backticked token containing `/`, so a path that does not exist is never reported. While
the name could not be cited, the pull-request number was what made the citation checkable; now the
name is, and it is a hypothesis of a theorem rather than a citation.

`AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion.specΓIsoTop` at `f`, whose source is `Spec` of `P.alg`, applied
to the class of `p`. `ComplexAnalytic.Presentation.alg` is `ComplexAnalytic.PresentedAlgebra` by
`abbrev` and that is a quotient of the polynomial ring by `abbrev` again, so `Ideal.Quotient.mk` is
the only step between a polynomial and an element of the algebra and no coercion is inserted here.

**The morphism is arbitrary and that is the point.** A member of a cover datum reaches this at
`ComplexAnalytic.specSchemeIota`; a member of a *second* datum carried into the first datum's
scheme reaches it at `ComplexAnalytic.specSchemeIotaMap`, which is not `specSchemeIota` of anything
in the first datum. Stating it once at the immersion is what lets the cross-datum theorem at the
end of this file spell its two sides with the same word. -/

/-- **Every section over the range comes from a polynomial in the presentation's variables.**

Two surjections composed: `AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion.specΓIsoTop` is an isomorphism, and
`Ideal.Quotient.mk_surjective` covers its target. Nothing else is used — in particular the
presentation's relations `P.g` play no part, and the polynomial produced is unique only modulo
them.

**`simp` does not close the last step and `CategoryTheory.Iso.inv_hom_id_apply` does.** The goal
after the rewrite is `e.hom (e.inv s) = s` for the isomorphism `e`, which is that lemma on the
nose; the `simp` set reaches it only through the `ConcreteCategory` coercion and does not here.
(The direction is the one it is because
`AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion.specΓIsoTop` runs `R ≅ Γ(Y, f.opensRange)`, following
`AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion.ΓIsoTop`; a first version of this file ran the other way and
this sentence named `CategoryTheory.Iso.hom_inv_id_apply`.)

**The `change` is what keeps the definition above from acquiring an equation lemma, and that is
measured rather than assumed.** The step it replaces was `rw [presentationSection, hp]`, which
names a `def` as a rewrite rule and so asks Lean to generate `presentationSection.eq_1`:
`scripts/DumpOkaDecls.lean` then reports one declaration more for this module than it declares.
`change` goes through definitional unfolding and generates nothing. It is `change` and not `show`
because the style linter rejects `show` in this position, and this repository already uses `change`
for exactly this job. -/
