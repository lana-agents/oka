# The glue data of an affine cover with distinguished overlaps

`Oka/Analytification/DistinguishedOpen.lean` identifies the analytification of `A_f` with the
distinguished open `D(f) ⊆ X^an`, **over `X^an`**, and `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Glue.lean` glues an
analytic space out of an `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData` whose pieces are
analytic. This file is the step between them: from a family of presentations, a distinguished
open of each for every other member, and a `ℂ`-algebra isomorphism identifying the two
descriptions of each overlap, it builds the glue data.

## The input, and why it is presentations rather than a scheme

**Nothing here turns an `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme` into the data below, and the obstruction is
the arity of `poly`.** The `variable` line below declares it as `∀ i : J, J → MvPolynomial …`:
for each *ordered pair*, one polynomial, hence **one** distinguished open of the `i`-th member.
A scheme supplies less. `AlgebraicGeometry.exists_basicOpen_le_affine_inter` is stated at a
*point* of `U ⊓ V` and returns an open distinguished in both that contains it, so the
intersection of two affine members is a **union** of such opens, and nothing makes one of them
the whole of it. That is a claim about this file's own input, and **only an edit to this file can
falsify it** — which is the property the sentence it replaces lacked. That one counted
occurrences of `Scheme` across the whole tree at `master` = `31f5a2f` and concluded that every
scheme here is a `Spec`; `Oka/AlgebraicGeometry/Modules/Coherent.lean` carries
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.isCoherentStructureSheaf`, a theorem about an arbitrary scheme, and has
falsified it since fourteen and a half hours after this file landed.

**What is missing is the construction, not the sentence**, which that measurement also got wrong:
the target is sayable, and needs nothing from this repository. With
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Over` in scope for the structure morphism, so that `↘` names it, and
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyOfFiniteType` asserted of that morphism, a well-formed target is

    noncomputable def analytificationOfScheme (X : Scheme.{0})
        [X.Over (Spec (CommRingCat.of ℂ))]
        [LocallyOfFiniteType (X ↘ Spec (CommRingCat.of ℂ))] :
        ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.{0}

— note the universe, which is forced to `0` because `ℂ : Type` makes `Spec (CommRingCat.of ℂ)` a
`Scheme.{0}`. Everything else on this line is `{u}`-polymorphic and the scheme-level statement
cannot be.

So what this file takes is the cover **as data**: an index type `J`, a
`ComplexAnalytic.Presentation` for each index, a polynomial `poly i j` cutting out the part of the
`i`-th member that meets the `j`-th, and an isomorphism of the two presentations of the overlap.
The **members** lose nothing by that: `ComplexAnalytic.toFGAlg` is an equivalence onto the
finitely generated `ℂ`-algebras (`ComplexAnalytic.instIsEquivalenceToFGAlg`), so each of them is
an affine scheme locally of finite type over `ℂ`, transported. The **overlaps** are where the
general form differs, by the paragraph above, and what it would add is a comparison theorem —
that every such scheme arises this way, or that a cover of one can be refined until it does —
together with a choice among Mathlib's cover APIs. Neither is needed by anything downstream.
`Oka/Analytification/Comparison.lean` argues separately, in a titled section, that the absence of
`Scheme` from *its* statements is a result rather than an omission.

Only the **distinguished** case appears, and the reason is this repository's machinery rather
than the shape of a scheme's cover. `Oka/Analytification/DistinguishedOpen.lean` analytifies the
distinguished open `D(f)` and nothing else, and says in its own docstring that the
analytification of a general open immersion is neither proved nor wanted; a distinguished open
is therefore the only overlap this file has anything to build a transition from. That a scheme's
pairwise intersections are merely *covered by* opens distinguished in both is true, and is what
makes one open per pair a **restriction** rather than what licenses it — the paragraph above
says that of `poly`'s arity, and the one below names the Mathlib shape that carries the weaker
datum.

Mathlib does have a shape that carries what a scheme supplies at an overlap, and it is not the one
below: a **locally directed** cover, `Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Cover/Directed.lean`. It indexes
the members by a category, gives a transition morphism for each arrow, and asks only that every
point of a pairwise overlap be hit by a third member mapping into both — so overlaps are not
chosen at all, they are covered by other members of the same family.
`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Sites/SmallAffineZariski.lean` instantiates it for *every* scheme with
no hypotheses, indexed by the affine opens with an arrow `U ⟶ V` exactly when `U` is a
distinguished open of `V`, which is the data `Oka/Analytification/DistinguishedOpen.lean`
analytifies. Two things come with the shape and are the argument for it: the scheme is the colimit
of the family, and a morphism out of it glues from morphisms out of the members with compatibility
along the transition morphisms alone — no triple-overlap condition, where
`ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData` below needs `hrange` and `hcocycle`. Adopting it here would
replace `poly`, `hrange` and `hcocycle` together, and would need the analytified transition
morphism to be functorial in composition of arrows, which is not in this repository. Nothing
downstream of this file needs any of it yet.

## The shape of the construction, and where the content is

The route is `CategoryTheory.GlueData'` — the variant that asks for the overlaps only when
`i ≠ j` — followed by `CategoryTheory.GlueData.ofGlueData'` and
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isOpenImmersion_f'` for the `f_open` field. `GlueData'`
discharges `f_id`, `t_id` and the three degenerate branches of `t'`, all of which are bookkeeping.

What is left is `t'` and the cocycle, and **the whole of the difficulty is that `t'` is a
morphism between categorical pullbacks**, which no tactic can compute with. That is what
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.restrictInfIsoPullback` is for: it identifies
`pullback (f i j) (f i k)` with the open subspace `X_i|(D(f_ij) ⊓ D(f_ik))`, an object one can
name and restrict. With that identification:

* `t'` is `ComplexAnalytic.coverTriple` conjugated by two copies of it, and `t_fac` follows from
  the two factorisations of the identification together with the mono-ness of an open immersion;
* the **cocycle condition becomes exactly the hypothesis `hcocycle`**, because the conjugating
  isomorphisms cancel in pairs — the middle one of `t' i j k` is the same isomorphism as the
  first one of `t' j k i`, by construction.

So the two hypotheses this file asks the caller for, `hrange` and `hcocycle`, are statements
about morphisms of *open subspaces of the members*, which is the spelling a geometric input
arrives in and the one `Oka/Geometry/RingedSpace/PresheafedSpace/Gluing.lean`'s module docstring
argues for.

**And `hrange` asks for its content and no more.** The natural statement of it is a containment in
`D(f_jk) ⊓ D(f_ji)` — that is the open `ComplexAnalytic.coverTriplePart` restricts to, and it is
what `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.liftRestrict` consumes — but the `D(f_ji)` half of that
is a theorem. `ComplexAnalytic.coverTransitionHom` is *defined* as a composite ending in
`ComplexAnalytic.coverIncl`, whose range is exactly `D(f_ji)`, so nothing can land outside it
whatever the input is: `ComplexAnalytic.range_comp_coverTransitionHom_subset` proves it and
`ComplexAnalytic.coverTriple` supplies it with `Set.subset_inter`, leaving a caller the other half
alone. `Oka/Analytification/SpecAffineCover.lean`'s hypothesis of the same name was weakened
**together with this one, by taxis #1239**, and for the same reason:
`Oka/Analytification/CoverComparison.lean` holds both glue data over one input, and two hypotheses
of the same shape are one obligation discharged twice where two shapes are two.

## The diagonal

`poly` and `glue` are asked for at **every** pair, including `i = i`, but `hrange` and `hcocycle`
are required only at triples of *distinct* indices, which is all `CategoryTheory.GlueData'`
consumes. So the diagonal data is unused. It is not unconstrained: `hsymm` is quantified over
every pair and at `i = i` it says `glue i i = (glue i i).symm`, which a caller has to prove even
though nothing below reads it. That is weaker than `glue i i = Iso.refl` — it says only that the
transition is its own inverse — and `poly i i = 1` with `glue i i = Iso.refl` is the natural
choice, satisfies it, and is checked by nothing. Making `poly` partial instead would push a
`i ≠ j` argument through every definition below and into the type of every open subspace, which is
a much larger tax than one unused value per index.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.coverSpace`, `ComplexAnalytic.coverOpen`, `ComplexAnalytic.coverPart`: the
  `i`-th member `A_i^an`, the distinguished open `D(f_ij)` inside it, and that open as a space.
- `ComplexAnalytic.coverTransition`: the transition isomorphism `X_i|D(f_ij) ≅ X_j|D(f_ji)`,
  obtained from the given isomorphism of presentations by transporting it across
  `ComplexAnalytic.localisationIso` at each end.
- `ComplexAnalytic.coverTriple`: the transition on triple overlaps,
  `X_i|(D(f_ij) ⊓ D(f_ik)) ⟶ X_j|(D(f_jk) ⊓ D(f_ji))`, which is what `t'` is built from.
- `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData'` and `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData`: **the glue data.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification`: **the analytic space the cover glues to** — the
  gluing of the members' analytifications, and the first declaration in this file that is an
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` rather than a locally ringed space.
- `ComplexAnalytic.coverIota`: the `i`-th member's analytification, as a morphism of analytic
  spaces into it.
- `ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytificationOpenCover`: **`X^an` as an open cover by them**, which is
  the form `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.glueMorphisms` consumes.
- `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueMorphisms`: **a morphism out of `X^an`**, glued from morphisms out of
  the members which agree over the overlaps.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData_U` and `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData_ι_isOpenImmersion`: the
  members of the glue data are the analytifications one put in, and they are open subspaces of
  the gluing. Without the first, `coverGlueData` would be a well-typed object with no stated
  relation to its input.
- `ComplexAnalytic.glueDataCLinear_coverGlueData`: **the transitions are `ℂ`-linear**, for every
  input, so `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofGlueDataCLinear` applies and the gluing is an
  analytic space. The three lemmas it is built from —
  `ComplexAnalytic.comapAlgMap_coverOverlapIso`, `ComplexAnalytic.comapAlgMap_coverGlueIso` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.comapAlgMap_coverIncl_eq` — say where each factor of the transition gets its
  `ℂ`-linearity from.
- `ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification_toLocallyRingedSpace`: **the analytic space is the glue
  data's gluing**, with no transport — which is what lets every statement about
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData`'s gluing be read as a statement about `X^an`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isOpenImmersion_coverIota`: **the members are open subspaces of `X^an`**,
  which with `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData.ι_jointly_surjective` is the
  statement that they cover it.
- `ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytificationOpenCover_obj` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytificationOpenCover_map`: **the cover's members are the
  analytifications and its maps are `ComplexAnalytic.coverIota`**, both by `rfl`. Without them
  the cover is opaque and a consumer would be reading the glue data rather than `X^an`.
  (Naming `ComplexAnalytic.coverIota` here advertises it, so it is guarded below alongside them.)
- `ComplexAnalytic.coverOverlapIso_hom_coverIncl`: **the overlap's comparison isomorphism is one
  over the ambient member** — followed by the inclusion of `D(f_ij)` it is the projection of
  `Oka/Analytification/DistinguishedOpen.lean`. This is what lets a computation with
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverTransition` be pushed down to the member it sits over: it is what a
  refinement of a cover needs, it is why the declaration moved here from
  `Oka/Analytification/CoverComparison.lean`, and nothing in this file consumes it. (Named
  without citing the projection: `scripts/guard_coverage.py` reads every backticked repository
  name under this heading as a result *this* file advertises, and that one is another file's.)
- `ComplexAnalytic.range_coverTransitionHom_subset` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.range_comp_coverTransitionHom_subset`: **the transition into the ambient member
  cannot leave `D(f_ji)`**, whatever the input is. This is the half of the range condition that is
  a theorem rather than a hypothesis, and `ComplexAnalytic.coverTriple` is what consumes the
  second of the two. The mirrors on the `Spec` side are
  `ComplexAnalytic.range_specTransitionHom_subset` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.range_comp_specTransitionHom_subset`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.comm_coverGlueData`: **agreement over the overlaps is the glue datum's
  compatibility condition**, which is what makes `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueMorphisms` statable —
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.glueMorphisms` asks for agreement over a categorical pullback
  and a glue datum has no such object in it. Its hypothesis is at `i ≠ j`, since a caller has
  nothing to say about the diagonal.
- `ComplexAnalytic.coverIota_comp_coverGlueMorphisms` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification_hom_ext`: **the glued morphism restricts to the given one
  on each member, and it is the only one that does** — the universal property in the form a
  caller uses it. `ComplexAnalytic.toLRSHom_coverGlueMorphisms` puts the first at the
  locally-ringed-space level.
- `ComplexAnalytic.coverIncl_comp_coverIota`: **the members' own inclusions agree over the
  overlaps**, the glue datum's `glue_condition` read back into this file's vocabulary, and
- `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueMorphisms_coverIota`: **gluing them returns the identity.** The
  readable instance of `ComplexAnalytic.coverIota_comp_coverGlueMorphisms` at the members' own
  inclusions, and a corollary of it in one rewrite — which is worth saying, because the statement
  that rules out a definition ignoring its family is that one and not this one.
- `ComplexAnalytic.injective_base_coverIota`: **each member's inclusion is injective on points**,
  which an intersection of two members' images has to be told.
- `ComplexAnalytic.coverIota_image_coverOpen`: **the two members meet where the datum says they
  do** — `D(f_ij)` and `D(f_ji)` have the same image in `X^an`. Not a statement that they meet in
  nothing else; that is about the gluing and is not here.

## What is not here

* **No input exhibited in this file, and no scheme.** Nothing below exhibits an input for
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification`; the two instances are elsewhere and both now **quote**
  this construction rather than rebuilding it. `OkaTest/AffineCover.lean`'s three-member node
  cover is the one that is evidence — `ComplexAnalytic.base_nodeIota_nodeOrigin_ne` says its
  three copies of the origin are three distinct points of the analytic space — since
  `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.hRange_of_no_three` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.GlueShape.hCocycle_of_no_three` make both triple-overlap hypotheses vacuous
  below three members, so `OkaTest/ProjectiveLine.lean`'s two-member `ℙ¹` exercises neither. What
  `ℙ¹` adds is a **non-identity transition**, which the node cover does not have. Nor is any of
  this related to a *scheme*: the input is presentations and isomorphisms, and no statement here
  says they present one. **This bullet's heading said "no non-vacuity in this file" until the
  statements about `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueMorphisms` arrived** — chiefly
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverIota_comp_coverGlueMorphisms`, which rules out a
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueMorphisms` that ignores its family, and its instance
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueMorphisms_coverIota` — and so reads to a grep as this bullet's
  contradiction. The two senses are different and both hold: nothing here exhibits an *input*, and
  statements here rule out a degenerate *output*.
* **Any statement that a gluing is not affine.** The two instances of this construction check
  different things and neither subsumes the other. `OkaTest/AffineCover.lean` glues three copies
  of the node along the punctured axis and shows that their three copies of the origin are three
  *distinct* points of the gluing, which is what rules out a construction quietly returning its
  first member. `OkaTest/ProjectiveLine.lean` glues two copies of the affine line along `D(z)` by
  `z ↦ 1/z` and shows that **neither member's inclusion is surjective**, so the glued space is
  equal to no one member; that is the stronger statement and it is proved only there. Neither
  exhibits a space that is not the analytification of *some* presentation, which is stronger
  again and needs an invariant nothing here computes.
* **`Localization.Away`.** Nothing here needs
  `ComplexAnalytic.PresentedAlgebra (localisationPresentation g f)` to *be* a localisation; it
  needs the structure map and its analytification, both of which
  `Oka/Analytification/LocalisationFunctor.lean` provides. See that file and
  `Oka/Analytification/DistinguishedOpen.lean`'s `## What is not here`.

/-! ### The members of the cover and their overlaps -/

/-- **The `i`-th member of the cover**, `A_i^an`, as a locally ringed space.

Everything in this file before `ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification` is spelled at the
locally-ringed-space level, and deliberately: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`'s `Category`
instance defines composition through `toLRSHom`, so unifying two composites of analytic morphisms
forces it open and is expensive enough to exhaust the heartbeat budget on a three-term
`Iso.trans`. A glue data is a locally-ringed-space object anyway.

**The last two sections are the exceptions and cannot be anything else**, their whole point being
to produce an analytic space and then a morphism out of it: `### The analytic space, and its
members` and `### Morphisms out of X^an`. They are named rather than called "the last", because
this paragraph has now gone stale twice — once as each of them arrived — and both times the
pointer broke before any claim did.

**What keeps the policy in force there is that each exception carries its own way back down.**
`ComplexAnalytic.toLRSHom_coverIota` puts `ComplexAnalytic.coverIota` at the level the rest of the
file works at, which is how `ComplexAnalytic.isOpenImmersion_coverIota` is a statement the glue
data's own `ι` lemma proves, and `ComplexAnalytic.toLRSHom_coverGlueMorphisms` is the same `rfl`
for `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueMorphisms`.

**Two statements in `### Morphisms out of X^an` do compose in the
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` category** — `ComplexAnalytic.coverIota_comp_coverGlueMorphisms`
and `ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification_hom_ext`, and the `reassoc` on the first generates a
three-term composite as well. So "it composes nothing", which was arithmetic about this file until
that section arrived, is no longer why the exception is cheap. **The reason now is that every one
of those proofs goes back down before it unifies anything**, through
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.forgetToLocallyRingedSpace.map_injective` — under a `change` in the
first and a `congrArg` in the second — so the `Category` instance is never forced open on a
composite. Stating a composite in that category is affordable; asking a proof to unify two of them
is what this paragraph is about, and there is still no such proof in this file. -/

`ComplexAnalytic.coverTransition` because the three-term `Iso.trans` there has to unify the

`ComplexAnalytic.toLRSHom_localisationProj` in this file's vocabulary:
`ComplexAnalytic.coverOverlapIso` is `ComplexAnalytic.localisationIso` pushed through the
forgetful functor and `ComplexAnalytic.coverIncl` is the inclusion of the open subspace, so their
composite is `ComplexAnalytic.localisationProj`. It holds definitionally and is stated because
its consumers need it in this spelling: inside a `rw` in
`Oka/Analytification/CoverRefinement.lean`, and as the argument of a `congrArg` in a `calc` in
`Oka/Analytification/CoverComparison.lean`.

**It is the only route from `ComplexAnalytic.coverTransition` to a statement about the ambient
members**, whose two outer factors are this isomorphism at the two ends. A caller who knows what
the *algebraic* glue does over a common base can conclude what the transition does over it, and
that is what discharges `hrange` and `hcocycle` for a cover whose members all lie over one space
— `Oka/Analytification/CoverRefinement.lean`.

It stood in `Oka/Analytification/CoverComparison.lean` until it acquired that second consumer,
which cannot reach it there: that file imports the whole `Spec` side, and a refinement of an
analytic cover has nothing to do with schemes. Here it costs nothing —
`ComplexAnalytic.toLRSHom_localisationProj` is in this file's import closure already — where the
other direction would have cost `Oka/Analytification/CoverRefinement.lean` four `Oka` modules to

  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.hom_ext_restrict` turns into an equation over `X_j`, and

/-! ### The transitions are `ℂ`-linear

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofGlueDataCLinear` turns a glue data of analytic pieces into an
analytic space provided its transitions are `ℂ`-linear (`ComplexAnalytic.GlueDataCLinear`). For a
glue data built here that hypothesis is **automatic**, and the reason is that every morphism in
sight is a morphism of *analytic* spaces, whose `ℂ`-linearity is a field rather than something to
prove: `ComplexAnalytic.coverOverlapIso` is `ComplexAnalytic.localisationIso` and
`ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueIso` is the given algebra isomorphism analytified, both read through
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.forgetToLocallyRingedSpace`.

The work is therefore transport rather than algebra, and it is done in the three lemmas below:
each factor of `ComplexAnalytic.coverTransition` is recognised as an analytic morphism, and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.comapAlgMap_toLRSHom` turns that into the equation of
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.comapAlgMap`s the predicate is stated with.
-/

/-- **The overlap's own analytic structure is the one it inherits from the `i`-th member.**

`ComplexAnalytic.coverOverlapIso` followed by the inclusion of `D(f_ij)` is

morphism of analytic spaces, so this is that morphism's `ℂ`-linearity field. -/

This is where the input's algebraic content is used, and it is free: `glue i j` is an isomorphism
of *presentations*, so `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFunctor` sends it to an isomorphism of
analytic spaces, and its `ℂ`-linearity is that morphism's own field. Nothing here computes with
the isomorphism. -/

`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.comapAlgMap_hom_injective` says pulling back along an
isomorphism loses nothing; there both sides become the overlap's own structure, by the two lemmas
above and the cancellation of `ComplexAnalytic.coverOverlapIso` against itself inside

The content is `ComplexAnalytic.comapAlgMap_coverIncl_eq`; the rest is getting past the `dite`s
that `CategoryTheory.GlueData.ofGlueData'` fills the diagonal with, by
`CategoryTheory.GlueData.ofGlueData'_f_of_ne` and
`CategoryTheory.GlueData.ofGlueData'_t_comp_f_of_ne`.

Two places want a term rather than a rewrite and the second is not optional. The diagonal case is
an equation of *morphisms*, so `congrArg` disposes of it without touching the structures. Off the
diagonal both sides carry the same `eqToHom` prefix, and
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.comapAlgMap_comp` has to be applied **as a term**: the
corresponding `rw` reports *did not find an occurrence of the pattern
`comapAlgMap (?f ≫ ?g) ?γ`* against a goal that visibly has that shape, and it still does after
`dsimp only [CategoryTheory.GlueData.ofGlueData']`, so delta-reducing the projections in the goal
is not the remedy. **Why it fails is not established here** and no explanation should be read
into it; the contrast worth having is that
`ComplexAnalytic.comapAlgMap_coverIncl_eq` above rewrites with the same lemma twice and
successfully, at the same category, on a composite that has not come through

/-! ### The analytic space, and its members

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofGlueDataCLinear` needs three things beyond the glue data: the
`ℂ`-algebra structure on each member, the `ℂ`-linearity of the transitions, and local models on
each member. The first and third are the analytification's own — `coverSpace obj i` **is**
`(analytification (obj i).g).toLocallyRingedSpace`, by `rfl`, so `local_model` applies verbatim
— and the second is `ComplexAnalytic.glueDataCLinear_coverGlueData` above. So the construction
costs nothing at this level, and the content is in the two statements after it.
-/

/-- **The analytic space an affine cover with distinguished overlaps glues to.**

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofGlueDataCLinear` at `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData`, with the
members' own `ℂ`-algebra structures and local models. Every hypothesis is discharged by a
declaration above or by the analytification itself; nothing new is proved by this definition, and
the two theorems below are what make it usable.

**Not "the analytification of a scheme", and the module docstring's titled section is why.**
Nothing here says the input presents one, and a scheme's cover does not supply this input in
general: `poly` asks for **one** distinguished open of the `i`-th member per *ordered pair*, while
`AlgebraicGeometry.exists_basicOpen_le_affine_inter` is stated at a *point* of an intersection and
gives one such open there — so the intersection of two affine members is a **union of such
opens**, and nothing makes one of them the whole of it. -/

underlying locally ringed space, and until this there was no such cover of
`ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification` — so the space this file builds could not be the source of

`ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification_toLocallyRingedSpace` is

three `rfl`s make the two lemmas below `rfl` as well: `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData_U` for the
members and `ComplexAnalytic.toLRSHom_coverIota` for the maps.

**Those two lemmas are not decoration.** Without them this is a cover whose members and maps are
spelled in the glue data's vocabulary — a cover of a gluing wearing an analytic space's name —

/-! ### Morphisms out of `X^an`

`ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytificationOpenCover` makes
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.glueMorphisms` *applicable* to `X^an`; it does not make it usable.
Its hypothesis is agreement over the **categorical pullback** of two members' inclusions, and
nothing in this file produces one: what a caller holds is a family of morphisms out of the
`A_i^an` together with a statement about `ComplexAnalytic.coverIncl` and
`ComplexAnalytic.coverTransition`, which are the only overlap data the input carries.

Two transports close the gap and neither is this file's own.
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData.pullback_condition_of_comm` turns agreement over a
glue datum's chosen overlaps into the pullback condition; `CategoryTheory.GlueData.ofGlueData'_comm`
turns agreement over *these* overlaps into agreement over the glue datum's, which is not the same
statement because `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData` goes through
`CategoryTheory.GlueData.ofGlueData'` and that fills the diagonal with `dite`s. The composite is
`ComplexAnalytic.comm_coverGlueData` below, and the hypothesis it asks for is at `i ≠ j` — a
caller has nothing to say about `coverTransition i i`, which is whatever `glue i i` is.

**`ComplexAnalytic.comm_coverGlueData` is stated at a locally ringed space target and not at an
analytic one**, deliberately: the comparison morphism `X^an ⟶ X` maps to a scheme, which is a
locally ringed space and not an analytic space, so a version tied to
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` would serve one consumer of this file and not the other.

**`ComplexAnalytic.coverIota_comp_coverGlueMorphisms` is what says the construction is not
degenerate**, and `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueMorphisms_coverIota` is its instance at the members'
own inclusions rather than a second control — it constrains `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueMorphisms`
at one family where the general lemma constrains it at every family.

**The criterion is "is about `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueMorphisms` and mentions `f`", and exactly
two statements here meet it**: that one and `ComplexAnalytic.toLRSHom_coverGlueMorphisms`. Having
`f` on the right-hand side is not the criterion and would give three —
`ComplexAnalytic.comm_coverGlueData` does too, and a `coverGlueMorphisms` ignoring its family
would satisfy it perfectly well, because that theorem is about the glue datum and an arbitrary
family and never mentions this construction at all. **The two come apart on exactly that
statement**, which is why the criterion is worth stating rather than leaving to be read off the
right-hand sides.

**Nothing else here constrains the definition at all**, and that is a statement about the
statements rather than about hypothetical definitions:
`ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification_hom_ext`, `ComplexAnalytic.comm_coverGlueData` and
`ComplexAnalytic.coverIncl_comp_coverIota` do not mention `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueMorphisms`, so
their truth is independent of how it is defined; and the round trip, being an instantiation,
constrains it only where the family is `ComplexAnalytic.coverIota`.
-/

/-- **A family of morphisms out of the members which agrees over the overlaps satisfies the glue
datum's compatibility condition.**

`CategoryTheory.GlueData.ofGlueData'_comm` at `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData'`. The hypothesis is
at `i ≠ j` and the conclusion at every pair: `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData`'s diagonal is
`CategoryTheory.GlueData.ofGlueData'`'s `eqToHom`s and not `ComplexAnalytic.coverTransition i i`,
so there is nothing there for a caller to check.

The target is a `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace`, so that this serves both the analytic
morphism below and the comparison morphism to the scheme, whose target is not an analytic
space. -/

`ComplexAnalytic.coverIncl_comp_coverIota` is the whole content, read on ranges rather than on
morphisms: the range of `ComplexAnalytic.coverIncl` is the open it restricts to

out of `ComplexAnalytic.coverPart`, and the transition between the two composites is an
isomorphism, whose base is therefore surjective.

**This is not the statement that the two members meet in *nothing else***, which would say
`Set.range` of the two inclusions intersect in exactly this set and is a statement about the
gluing rather than about the two composites; nothing here is evidence about it in either
direction. -/
