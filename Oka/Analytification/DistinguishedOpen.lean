# The analytification of a distinguished open is a distinguished open of the analytification

For `A = ℂ[x₁, …, x_n] ⧸ (g₁, …, g_k)` and `f ∈ ℂ[x]`, the localisation `A_f` is presented by
adjoining one variable and one equation,

  `A_f = ℂ[x₁, …, x_n, t] ⧸ (g₁, …, g_k, t·f - 1)`,

and this file proves that the analytification of that presentation **is** the open subspace of
`X^an = A^an` on which `f` does not vanish:

  `ComplexAnalytic.localisationIso : (A_f)^an ≅ X^an|D(f)`,

**over `X^an`** — `ComplexAnalytic.localisationIso_hom_ofRestrict` and
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationIso_inv_localisationProj` say the isomorphism commutes with the
projection `(A_f)^an ⟶ X^an` and with the inclusion of the open subspace. Without that the
statement would only compare two spaces that happen to be isomorphic, and would say nothing
about the immersion.

This is the input the analytification of a *non-affine* scheme needs, and the reason it is worth
stating on its own. `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Glue.lean` already glues an analytic space out of a glue
data of analytic pieces; what a glue data needs from *this* side is that the transition maps are
open immersions, and a scheme locally of finite type over `ℂ` is covered by affines whose pairwise
intersections are covered by opens distinguished in both. So it is the **distinguished** case
that is needed, and the analytification of a general open immersion is neither needed for it nor
proved here. Assembling the analytification of a non-affine scheme is a further step and is not
taken in this file.

## The route: the universal property, twice

Both maps are `ComplexAnalytic.liftHom`, which is why this is one file rather than a construction
plus a comparison.

* **Forwards.** `ComplexAnalytic.localisationProj` is the universal property of `X^an` applied to
  the first `n` coordinates of `(A_f)^an`; they satisfy the `gⱼ` because the `gⱼ` occur among the
  equations of the larger presentation, renamed along the inclusion of the variables. Its image
  lies in `D(f)` because the last equation says that `f`, pulled back, is invertible in
  `Γ((A_f)^an, 𝒪)`, so its *value* at every point is invertible in `ℂ`, hence nonzero — this is
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.mem_nonvanishing_iff`, and it is the only genuinely geometric
  step in the file. `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftOpen` then factors it through `X^an|D(f)`.

* **Backwards.** `ComplexAnalytic.restrictToLocalisation` is the universal property of
  `(A_f)^an` applied to the tuple which is the restriction of the coordinates of `X^an` on the
  old variables and the **inverse** of the restriction of `f` on the new one. That inverse exists
  by `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isUnit_resΓ_nonvanishing`, which is why that statement has to
  be about a unit rather than about non-vanishing.

* **The round trips** are `ComplexAnalytic.hom_ext_analytification` on one side and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_restrict` followed by it on the other: a morphism into
  an open subspace is determined by its composite with the inclusion, and a morphism into an
  analytification by the pullbacks of the coordinates.

## Non-vacuity

An isomorphism of analytifications is weak evidence on its own —
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationIsoOfPresentationIdealEq` already produces plenty, and every
statement here is satisfied by `D(f) = ⊤` and the identity. What rules that reading out is
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationOpen_ne_top`: if `f` vanishes at some point of `X^an` then `D(f)` is
a **proper** open subset. `OkaTest/AnalytificationDistinguishedOpen.lean` runs it at the node,
where `D(z₀)` is the punctured axis that `OkaTest/OpenSubspace.lean` builds by hand.

The three existential statements added later, under
`### Every distinguished open upstairs comes from one downstairs`, split the same way and it is
worth saying which is which. `ComplexAnalytic.exists_pow_mul_eq_rename` is an equation in the
polynomial ring with no point in it, so nothing can make it degenerate. The two about opens are
equalities of subsets of `(A_f)^an`, and if that space were empty they would hold of nothing.
`OkaTest.CoverRefinement.exists_over` produces a point of such a space, at the empty base in one
variable — obtained from `ComplexAnalytic.range_base_localisationProj` rather than by writing a
coordinate down, which is why it was affordable there.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentation`: **the presentation of `A_f`** — the `gⱼ` in one more
  variable, together with `t·f - 1`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.localisationProj`: **the projection `(A_f)^an ⟶ X^an`.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.localisationOpen`: `D(f) ⊆ X^an`, the non-vanishing locus of `f`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.localisationIso`: **the isomorphism `(A_f)^an ≅ X^an|D(f)`.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentedAlgebraEquiv`: **the algebra `A_f` presents really is the
  localisation** `Localization.Away f`.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.localisationIso_hom_ofRestrict` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.localisationIso_inv_localisationProj`: **the isomorphism is one over `X^an`.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.eval_localisationProj` and `ComplexAnalytic.base_localisationProj`: the
  projection forgets the last coordinate.
- `ComplexAnalytic.mem_localisationOpen_iff`: a point lies in `D(f)` exactly when `f` does not
  vanish there.
- `ComplexAnalytic.localisationOpen_one`: **`D(1)` is the whole space**, which is the extreme
  opposite of the bullet below and is what a refinement with a trivial refining family asks for.
- `ComplexAnalytic.localisationOpen_ne_top`: **`D(f)` is a proper open subset** whenever `f` has a
  zero on `X^an`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.localisationOpen_mul`: **`D(f · f') = D(f) ⊓ D(f')`** — the triple overlap of
  an affine cover, as one of the opens this file is about rather than an intersection of two.
- `ComplexAnalytic.localisationOpen_rename`: **the open cut out upstairs by a renamed polynomial
  is the preimage of the one it cuts out downstairs.** Where the lemma above relates two opens of
  one space, this relates opens of two, which is what a refinement of a cover needs in order to
  say where a point of an overlap lies.
- `ComplexAnalytic.exists_localisationOpen_eq_rename` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.exists_localisationOpen_eq_comap`: **the converse of the lemma above, for all
  distinguished opens at once** — every distinguished open of `(A_f)^an` is cut out by a renamed
  polynomial of the base, equivalently is the preimage of a distinguished open of `X^an`. The
  first form produces the *polynomial*, which is what a caller obliged to supply one needs; the
  second is the same fact about opens.
- `ComplexAnalytic.exists_pow_mul_eq_rename`: **clearing the denominator**, the algebra underneath
  those two and a statement about the polynomial ring alone — the equations `gⱼ` are not used and
  no point is mentioned.
- `ComplexAnalytic.eval_rename_localisationIncl_ne_zero`: **`f` vanishes nowhere on `(A_f)^an`**,
  the last equation of the presentation read at a point.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isOpenImmersion_localisationProj`: **the projection is an open immersion of
  locally ringed spaces** — the `f_open` field of any
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData` built out of an affine cover, and the second
  thing such a glue data needs from this file, alongside the isomorphism.
- `ComplexAnalytic.range_base_localisationProj`: **the image of the projection is exactly
  `D(f)`** — the equality, where `ComplexAnalytic.range_base_localisationProj_subset` is the
  containment. The side condition of an open-immersion lift is a containment *in* this range, so
  the equality is what lets a statement about `D(f)` discharge it.
- `ComplexAnalytic.map_presentationIdeal_localisationPresentation`: the reindexing carries the
  ideal of `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentation` to `MvPolynomial.awayIdeal`, which is the
  whole content of the identification on this side; the ring theory is in the mirror tree.

## What is not here

**Nothing in the geometry uses that `ℂ[x, t] ⧸ (g, t·f - 1)` is a localisation of `ℂ[x] ⧸ (g)`,
and until 2026-08-24 nothing proved it.** Everything from `ComplexAnalytic.localisationProj` down
is a statement about `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentation` as a *tuple of polynomials*, and
neither the statements nor the proofs mention a localisation; the first paragraph's
`A_f = ℂ[x₁, …, x_n, t] ⧸ (g₁, …, g_k, t·f - 1)` was the classical fact and not a formal one.

It is now proved, in the last section of this file, because **a consumer analytifying an actual
scheme needs it** and cannot get it from the geometry: what a scheme hands you at an overlap is an
isomorphism of *localisations*, and what
`Oka/Analytification/AffineCover.lean`'s `glue` field asks for is an isomorphism of the algebras
these presentations present. The two are `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentedAlgebraEquiv` apart.
The ring theory in it is general and lives in `Oka/RingTheory/MvPolynomial/Localization.lean`; this
file contributes only the reindexing of `Fin (n + 1)` as `Option (Fin n)` that names the new
variable, which is the one part of it that is about `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentation`.

**The geometry is unchanged and still does not assume it.** `ComplexAnalytic.localisationIso`
and both factorisations are statements about `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentation` as a
tuple of polynomials, and neither their statements nor their proofs mention a localisation.

/-! ### Every distinguished open upstairs comes from one downstairs

`ComplexAnalytic.localisationOpen_rename` above says that a polynomial of the base, read in the
extra variable, cuts out of `(A_f)^an` exactly what lies over what it cuts out of `X^an`. This
section is the **converse**, and it is a statement about all distinguished opens rather than about
one: *every* distinguished open of `(A_f)^an` arises that way. Nothing upstairs is new.

The reason is one line of algebra. A point of `(A_f)^an` is a point `x` of `D(f)` together with the
value `1/f(x)` in the extra coordinate, so a polynomial `q` in `n + 1` variables takes the value
`Σ_d c_d(x) · f(x)^(-d)` there, and multiplying by `f(x)^D` for `D` large clears every denominator
and leaves a polynomial in `x` alone. `ComplexAnalytic.exists_pow_mul_eq_rename` is that
computation, done on polynomials modulo the relation `t·f - 1` rather than on values, and
`ComplexAnalytic.exists_localisationOpen_eq_rename` is the geometric consequence — the multiplier
is invertible at every point of `(A_f)^an`, so it does not move a non-vanishing locus.

**What this is for.** A refinement of an affine cover that refines *across* members has to cut its
overlaps out of a localisation, and `Oka/Analytification/AffineCover.lean`'s `poly` field asks for
**one polynomial per ordered pair** — its module docstring says in terms that this arity is a
restriction, because a general scheme's pairwise intersections are only *covered* by opens
distinguished in both. Between two members of a cover **already in that shape** the restriction
costs nothing, and this section is the half of that which was missing: every distinguished open of
a localisation is cut out by a renamed polynomial of the member it sits in.

**The other half is not below and the sentence above does not assert it**, but it is no longer
absent from the repository: that the overlap of two refined members *is* a distinguished open of
the localisation needs a distinguished open to pull back along a `ComplexAnalytic.PresHom` to a
distinguished open, and that is `Oka/Analytification/DistinguishedOpenPullback.lean`, which
imports this file. It is bookkeeping about `ComplexAnalytic.polyToGlobal` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.mem_nonvanishing_iff` rather than geometry, as this paragraph
predicted when it was still missing, and it is stated there rather than here because it needs
`Oka/Analytification/ChangeOfVariables.lean`, which this file does not import.

**Nothing there builds a refinement either**, and of the two remaining pieces this paragraph named
one is now here and the other is here in part. Transporting the original cover's own glue
isomorphism through two localisations is `ComplexAnalytic.refineCrossGlue`
(`Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberGlue.lean`), with the coherence triangle
`ComplexAnalytic.refineCrossGlue_hom_comp`. **This sentence read *"only one is still nowhere"* and
*"the two geometric laws across members are still nowhere"*, and the two no longer stand or fall
together**: `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumTransitionHom_localisationProj_of_ne`
(`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumTransition.lean`) is `hrange`'s cross-member analogue, the refined
transition lying over the original datum's own `ComplexAnalytic.coverTransitionHom` for want of any
morphism between two members to lie over. **It does not prove `hrange`**: at a triple whose three
members are pairwise different what is left is one containment, in the caller's own `D(q b c)`,
which `ComplexAnalytic.range_refineDatumTransitionHom_subset_iff` states as an *equivalence* and
not as a sufficient condition; and at the mixed triples `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlue` takes its
equal branch, whose triangle is over a *member*, so **that** square has no statement there — and
the square over an identification of the two members does, which is
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumRange.lean` and settles the other four shapes.
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumGlueData.lean` joins the five into one law, on two conditions it
adopts and proves necessary. This sentence ended *"the square has no statement there at all"*
until the first of those, and it then said **`hcocycle` is still nowhere**, which is no longer
true either: it is stated as `ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumCocycle`, which needed the assembled
range law because `ComplexAnalytic.coverTriple` takes a proof of it as an argument, and
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumHcocycle` (`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumCocycle.lean`) proves it
from the original datum's own three laws. The datum they are laws of is built out of its `poly`
field (`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumPoly`)
and its `glue` (`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlue`, both branches under a case split) — the latter
a function of a choice of extra factor and unit, which
`ComplexAnalytic.exists_refineDatumCross` (`Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberChoice.lean`) produces
at every ordered pair, algebraically and without saying that the overlap it refines to is the
geometric one — and it reaches a glue data under the two conditions the file above adopts and no
law at all (`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlueDataOfLaws`). **Nothing says a choice meets either
condition**, in either direction, and taxis #1287 is where that question lives. Nothing here is
about a scheme.

/-- **A variable of the larger polynomial ring is either the new one or an old one.**

through. -/

/-- **Clearing the denominator.** A polynomial `q` in the extra variable, multiplied by a high
enough power of `f`, is a renamed polynomial of the base — modulo the relation `t·f - 1`, which is
the correction term `r` in the statement.

**The name elides that correction term and the statement carries it.** There is no equation of
polynomials here: `t` is a free variable and `q = t` is already not renamed from anything. What is
true is the equation in `ℂ[x, t] ⧸ (t·f - 1)`, and the third existential is the witness that it
holds there.

The proof is `MvPolynomial.induction_on` and the three cases are the whole content:

* a constant, and an old variable, need no power of `f` at all;
* the **new** variable is where the relation is used, and it is used once — `t · f = 1` modulo the
  relation, so multiplying by one more `f` turns a trailing `t` into nothing and the exponent goes
  up by one;
* a sum takes the sum of the exponents rather than their maximum, which is what makes the
  bookkeeping `ring` rather than a case split on which of the two is larger.

**`gⱼ` plays no part** — the statement mentions only `f`, and the equations of the base are never
used. That is the reason it is stated before any point of `(A_f)^an` is mentioned: it is a fact
about the polynomial ring with one variable inverted, not about the analytic space. -/

The converse of `ComplexAnalytic.localisationOpen_rename`, and the sharper of the two forms: it

`poly` field of `Oka/Analytification/AffineCover.lean`'s cover datum — can take this one.

`ComplexAnalytic.exists_pow_mul_eq_rename` and nothing else. At a point of `(A_f)^an` the relation

`ComplexAnalytic.eval_rename_localisationIncl_ne_zero`, so `q` and the renamed `Q` vanish at
exactly the same points. **`D` disappears from the statement** because a non-vanishing locus does
not see a non-vanishing factor; it is the exponent that made the algebra work and it is not part
of the geometry.

preimage, but surjectively in this direction, which is the half a construction needs. -/

/-- **The projection factors as the comparison isomorphism followed by the inclusion of `D(f)`**,
at the locally-ringed-space spelling.

`ComplexAnalytic.localisationIso_hom_ofRestrict` is this equation one level up, between morphisms
of analytic spaces; this is it after `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom.toLRSHom`, which is the
form both statements below consume, since `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion`
and `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.range_ofRestrict` are about locally ringed spaces. -/

  congrArg AnalyticSpace.Hom.toLRSHom (localisationIso_hom_ofRestrict.{u} g f).symm

/-- **The comparison isomorphism is an isomorphism of locally ringed spaces.** It is carried
across by `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.forgetToLocallyRingedSpace`; stated because both
statements below need it as an instance and instance search does not produce it from the
`Iso`. -/
theorem isIso_toLRSHom_localisationIso_hom :
    IsIso ((localisationIso.{u} g f).hom.toLRSHom) :=
  (AnalyticSpace.forgetToLocallyRingedSpace.{u}.mapIso (localisationIso.{u} g f)).isIso_hom

/-- **The projection `(A_f)^an ⟶ X^an` is an open immersion of locally ringed spaces.**

This is what a glue data wants. `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData` is
`CategoryTheory.GlueData` together with one extra field, `f_open`, asserting that each `f i j` is
an open immersion, and in the glue data an affine cover produces `f i j` **is** this projection.

It is `ComplexAnalytic.localisationIso_hom_ofRestrict` read as a factorisation:
`localisationProj` is an isomorphism followed by the inclusion of an open subspace, and both of
those are open immersions.

Two seams are crossed by hand rather than by instance search, and neither is avoidable:

* `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isOpenImmersion_ofRestrict` supplies the inclusion's
  instance. Searching for it directly at this spelling **fails** — see that lemma's docstring for
  the measurement and the reason — so it is introduced as an ascribed `haveI`, where the term
  crosses the seam even though the search does not.
* `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.forgetToLocallyRingedSpace` carries the isomorphism, which is
  where `IsIso` comes from; `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom.toLRSHom` of a composite is a
  composite by `rfl`, since the category instance is defined that way, and no lemma in `Oka/`
  states it — `toLRSHom_comp`, in `OkaTest/HomToComplex.lean`, does, and the library cannot
  import the test library. -/

  haveI := isIso_toLRSHom_localisationIso_hom.{u} g f
  rw [toLRSHom_localisationProj]
  infer_instance

/-- **The image of the projection is exactly `D(f)`.**

`ComplexAnalytic.range_base_localisationProj_subset` is the containment, which is all the
universal property needs; this is the equality, which is what an open-immersion lift needs — the
side condition of `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.liftRestrict` and of Mathlib's
`IsOpenImmersion.lift` is a containment *in* this range, so it has to be rewritten into a
containment in `D(f)` before anything about `D(f)` can discharge it.

The isomorphism half of `ComplexAnalytic.toLRSHom_localisationProj` is surjective on points
(`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.homeoOfIso`), so the image is the image of the inclusion,
which is `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.range_ofRestrict`.

**The last step is `exact` and not `rw`, and that is not a stylistic choice.** `rw
[LocallyRingedSpace.range_ofRestrict]` here fails with *did not find an occurrence of the
pattern*: the goal is headed by `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom.toLRSHom` and the lemma by
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.ofRestrict`, which are `rfl`-equal and are different
discrimination-tree keys — the same seam
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isOpenImmersion_ofRestrict` records for instance search.
The term crosses it; neither instance search nor `rw`'s pattern match does. -/

/-! ### The presented algebra is the localisation

Everything above is about `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentation` as a tuple of polynomials.
This section says what the tuple *presents*: `ℂ[x, t] ⧸ (g, t·f - 1)` is the localisation of
`ℂ[x] ⧸ (g)` away from the image of `f`. The general statement, for any base ring and any ideal,
is `MvPolynomial.isLocalization_away_quotient_awayIdeal` in
`Oka/RingTheory/MvPolynomial/Localization.lean`; it is stated there with the new variable called
`none`, so all that is left here is the reindexing that identifies `Fin (n + 1)` with
`Option (Fin n)` in the way `ComplexAnalytic.localisationIncl` and
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationVar` do.
-/

/-- **The reindexing that names the new variable `none`**: `Fin (n + 1)` as `Option (Fin n)`,
sending `ComplexAnalytic.localisationVar` there and `ComplexAnalytic.localisationIncl` to `some`,
under the `ULift` this development carries on its variable types. -/

The identification the file's `## What is not here` used to disclaim. It is what turns an
isomorphism of localisations — which is what a scheme hands you at an overlap of two affine
members — into an isomorphism of the algebras two `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentation`s
present, which is what `Oka/Analytification/AffineCover.lean`'s `glue` field asks for.

An isomorphism rather than an `IsLocalization.Away` instance on this type, deliberately: the
instance is stated in the mirror tree, on the ring with the new variable called `none`, and
putting a second one here would mean an `Algebra (ComplexAnalytic.PresentedAlgebra n k g)`
instance on `ComplexAnalytic.PresentedAlgebra (n + 1) (k + 1) …` — an instance keyed on a type
this development uses everywhere, bought for a universal property that
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationRenameEquiv` already reaches in one step. -/
