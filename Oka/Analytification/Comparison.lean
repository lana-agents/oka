# The comparison morphism `X^an ⟶ X` is natural

`Oka/Analytification/Presentation.lean` builds, for each presentation `g`, a morphism of locally
ringed spaces `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpec g : X^an_g ⟶ Spec (ℂ[x] ⧸ (g))`, and
`Oka/Analytification/Functor.lean` makes `X^an_g` functorial in `g`. Neither says the two fit
together. This file does:

```
ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpecNatTrans :
  analytificationFunctor ⋙ AnalyticSpace.forgetToLocallyRingedSpace ⟶ specFunctor

ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFGAlgToSpec :
  analytificationFGAlg ⋙ AnalyticSpace.forgetToLocallyRingedSpace ⟶
    toCommRingCatOp ⋙ Spec.toLocallyRingedSpace
```

The first is naturality in the *presentation*; the second is the same statement with the
presentation removed, transported along the equivalence of `Oka/Analytification/Functor.lean`.
**The second is the analytification of a finitely generated `ℂ`-algebra together with its
comparison morphism, as a single piece of structure** — `X^an ⟶ X` is no longer a construction
performed once per presentation.

## The content is `Spec` of a square that was already proved

Naturality of `analytificationToSpec` needs exactly two things, both on `master` before this file:

* `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.toΓSpec_naturality`, in the mirror tree — the canonical
  map to the spectrum of the global sections is natural;
* `ComplexAnalytic.Γ_map_analytificationMap_comp_quotientToGlobal` — pulling a section back along
  the induced morphism is applying the `ℂ`-algebra map, i.e. `ComplexAnalytic.quotientToGlobal`
  is natural.

The second is the ring-level square, proved in `Oka/Analytification/ChangeOfVariables.lean` for
functoriality of `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationMap` rather than for this, and the geometric
statement is `Spec` of it. Three module docstrings called this "the next step" without estimating
it; the estimate is one `rw` and a `congrArg`.

## `Scheme` does not appear, and that is a result rather than an omission

Both functors land in `LocallyRingedSpace`: `AnalyticSpace.forgetToLocallyRingedSpace` on one
side, `Spec.locallyRingedSpaceObj` on the other. `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme` and
`AlgebraicGeometry.AffineScheme` appear in no statement in this file — only, as here, in prose.

That settles a question left open on `Oka/Analytification/Functor.lean`, whose source category is
the full subcategory of `CommAlgCat ℂ` on `Algebra.FiniteType`, opposite, rather than affine
`ℂ`-schemes. The reason given there for not passing to schemes was that `AffineScheme` is itself
defined as an essential image, so its inverse is a second choice-opaque object map. This file is
the evidence that the second one is never needed: the comparison is natural without it.

## `specFunctor` is not a new functor

`ComplexAnalytic.specFunctor` is stated directly — `P ↦ Spec (ℂ[x] ⧸ (g))` — so that the
naturality above is about the objects the rest of the development already names. It would be
useless if it were unrelated to `Oka/Analytification/Functor.lean`'s equivalence, so:

```
ComplexAnalytic.specFunctor_eq :
  toFGAlg ⋙ toCommRingCatOp ⋙ Spec.toLocallyRingedSpace = specFunctor
```

and it is `rfl`. That is what lets `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFGAlgToSpec` be built by
whiskering rather than by transporting along an isomorphism, and it is why the algebra-level
statement costs four lines rather than a comparison of two composites.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.specFunctor`: `Spec` of the presented algebra, as a functor on presentations.
- `ComplexAnalytic.toCommRingCatOp`: a finitely generated `ℂ`-algebra, read as a commutative ring,
  opposite.
- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpecNatTrans`: **the comparison morphism is natural in the
  presentation.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFGAlgToSpec`: **the comparison morphism is natural in the
  finitely generated `ℂ`-algebra**, with no presentation in the statement.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpec_naturality`: the square itself.
- `ComplexAnalytic.specFunctor_eq`: `ComplexAnalytic.specFunctor` is `Spec` after
  `ComplexAnalytic.toFGAlg`, definitionally.
- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpecNatTrans_app` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFGAlgToSpec_app`: the components of the two natural
  transformations. The first is `rfl`; the second is what keeps the algebra-level one from being
  a definition nothing can be computed from.

## What is not here

* **Anything non-affine.** #550's eventual goal is a functor on schemes locally of finite type,
  by gluing; nothing here glues.
* **Anything analytic.** As with `Oka/Analytification/ChangeOfVariables.lean` and
  `Oka/Analytification/Functor.lean`, every proof here is formal. The analytic content is
  upstream, in the universal property.
* **`Spec` as a functor to `Scheme`.** See above: it is not needed, not that it is missing.

Both sides of `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpec` are `toΓSpec` followed by `Spec` of

of the ring-level square `ComplexAnalytic.Γ_map_analytificationMap_comp_quotientToGlobal`. -/

two agree. Both functor laws are `Spec`'s own, after a `rfl` identifying the ring maps. -/

The presentation-level transformation whiskered by the inverse of the equivalence
`ComplexAnalytic.toFGAlg`, then the counit. This is the sense in which the analytification of an
affine `ℂ`-scheme of finite type comes with its comparison morphism as *structure*: the source is
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFGAlg`, whose statement mentions no tuple of polynomials, and the
target is `Spec` of the algebra itself. -/

Without this the transformation would be a definition nothing can be computed from — the same
obligation `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFGAlgObjIso` discharges for
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFGAlg`. The two identities are dropped by hand rather than by
`simp` because the two spellings of the objects are definitionally but not syntactically equal,
and `Category.id_comp` has to be told which category it is in. -/
