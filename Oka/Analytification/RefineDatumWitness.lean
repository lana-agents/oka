# A cross-member refined cover datum at a non-constant `σ`, for every cover datum

`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumCocycle.lean` leaves `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlueDataOfLaws`
and `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumAnalytificationOfLaws` asking a caller for the original datum's
three laws and the two conditions `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumGlueData.lean` adopts,
`ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumRangeCross` and `ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumRangeEq`. Its own
`## What is not here` says, as five files on this line say:

> **No witness.** There is still no example of a refined cover datum at a non-constant `σ`, which
> is taxis #1107's fourth deliverable, and nothing here discharges either of the two conditions.

**There is one now, and it is not one example.** For *every* cover datum and *every* index map
`σ : B → J`, the refinement whose refining family is constantly `1` and whose cutting polynomial
is the original datum's own meets both conditions, with no hypothesis beyond the original datum's
`hrange`. `σ` is not constant as soon as `J` has two elements, which
`ComplexAnalytic.not_isConstant_id` records.

## The route, and the negative it corrects

`ComplexAnalytic.exists_refineDatumCross` (`Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberChoice.lean`) has `q`
in its **conclusion**, so a caller cannot name `q` and then ask it for `r` and `u`, and a witness
built by picking a small `q` and appealing to it does not exist. That is a fact about that lemma
and not about the construction: `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlue` and everything above it take
`q`, `r`, `u` and the two equations **as arguments**, so a witness never calls it — it exhibits
`r` and `u`.

`ComplexAnalytic.exists_refineDatumCross_of_isUnit`
(`Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberDatumGlue.lean`) is what exhibits them, at any `q` and `fam`
whose four polynomials are units in the two localisations. Here:

* `q a b := poly (σ a) (σ b)` is the polynomial that was **inverted** in the algebra the equations
  live in, so `ComplexAnalytic.isUnit_mk_rename_localisationIncl` is the hypothesis verbatim;
* `fam a := 1`, and `1` is a unit.

## Why the two range conditions cost nothing at this `q`

**`ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumRangeCross` becomes the free half.** Its target is
`D(q b c)` inside `obj (σ b)^an`, and at `q b c = poly (σ b) (σ c)` that open **is**
`ComplexAnalytic.coverOpen obj poly (σ b) (σ c)` — which is precisely the containment
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumTransition.lean` and `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumRange.lean`
prove unconditionally at each of the three shapes the condition is quantified over:
`ComplexAnalytic.range_refineDatumTransitionHom_localisationProj_subset_of_eq_ab` at
`σ a = σ b`, `..._of_eq_ac` at `σ a = σ c`, and
`ComplexAnalytic.range_refineDatumTransitionHom_localisationProj_subset` — the only one that
reads the original datum's `hrange` — where the three members are different. The fourth
combination cannot occur: `σ a = σ b` with `σ a = σ c` forces `σ b = σ c`, which the condition
excludes. **So the residue this whole line adopted as a hypothesis on the caller is, at the
caller's own `q = poly ∘ σ`, a theorem.**

**`ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumRangeEq` becomes `D(1) = ⊤`**, which is
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationOpen_one`. Its target is `D(fam c)` transported across `σ b = σ c`,
and `ComplexAnalytic.mem_localisationOpen_transport_one` below states that transported form **at
abstract indices**, because `σ b` and `σ c` are terms and `subst` is unavailable where it is used
— the move `ComplexAnalytic.mem_localisationOpen_coverSpaceHomOfEq` makes and
`ComplexAnalytic.coverTransitionHom_of_fac_eq_ab` makes, at a third site.

## What this witness is not, and the honest reading of it

**The refining family is trivial, so nothing is refined.** Every refined member is the
localisation of its original member at `1`, which is the whole of it, so what this exhibits is the
original cover **reindexed along an arbitrary `σ`** and not a proper refinement. What it does
exhibit, and what makes it a witness rather than a degeneracy, is that the cross-member `glue`
reads the original datum's own `glue` — through `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumCrossAlgEquiv`,
exactly once, as `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlueNe` does at any input — and that the refined
overlaps are the original overlaps, so nothing here is empty unless the original cover's overlaps
are. `OkaTest/CoverRefinement.lean` exists because this project accepted a degenerate witness
once, at `fam` constantly `0` where every overlap is empty; this is the opposite extreme and it is
named rather than left for a reader to notice.

**And the hypotheses below are met by something**, which nothing in `Oka/` can say because every
concrete cover datum in this repository is under `OkaTest/`:
`OkaTest/RefineDatumWitness.lean` instantiates the construction at `OkaTest/AffineCover.lean`'s
three copies of the node, whose three laws are theorems, at `σ = id` on a three-element index
type — giving an `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` with **no hypothesis left open at all** and an
index map `ComplexAnalytic.not_isConstant_id` proves is not constant. It also checks there that
every refined overlap is non-empty and proper, which is what separates this family from the `0`
one in both directions.

## What is not here

* **No witness at a refining family that is not a unit**, which is what a *proper* refinement at a
  non-constant `σ` would be. `ComplexAnalytic.exists_refineDatumCross_of_isUnit` says exactly what
  such a witness needs of its family — `fam a` a unit in the localisation at `f_{σa σb}`, which is
  the geometric statement that the refined member contains the whole overlap — and that is
  satisfiable by a family that cuts the member down: on the projective line the coordinate of each
  member is a unit on the overlap. **Nothing here builds one**, and the one condition that would
  not come free is `RefineDatumRangeEq`, which asks the transition's image to land in `D(fam c)`
  and has no free half at any file on this line.
* **Nothing about `ComplexAnalytic.exists_refineDatumCross`.** Whether the `q` it produces
  satisfies either condition is untouched here in both directions, and the associate question
  `Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberGlue.lean` records is not narrowed.
* **Nothing about whether the refined overlap is the geometric one**, which is the same file's
  other absence and is about the construction rather than about any input to it. **At one
  concrete datum that identification is now made**, in `OkaTest/RefineDatumWitness.lean`: at the
  node cover, `σ = id` and the caller's `q` taken to be the datum's own `poly`, the refined
  overlap is the preimage of the original overlap along the projection of the refined member.
  That is a fact about that data — the extra factor there is `z₀`, the original overlap's own
  polynomial, so `D(z₀ · z₀) = D(z₀)` and it cuts nothing away — and it is **not** evidence about
  the factor `ComplexAnalytic.exists_refineDatumCross` produces, which is what the absence is
  about.
* **No scheme, no `admissible`, and no comparison functor**, as in the files this one sits beside.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOneR` and `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOneU`: **the caller's `r` and
  `u` at the trivial refining family**, chosen from the criterion above.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOneGlueData` and `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOneAnalytification`:
  **the glue data and the analytic space this witness produces**, taking the original datum's
  three laws and nothing else.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.mem_localisationOpen_transport_one`: **every point lies in `D(1)`, in the
  transported form the range condition asks for**, at abstract indices.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOneRangeCross` and `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumOneRangeEq`: **the
  two adopted conditions, discharged** — the first from the original datum's `hrange` and the two
  free halves, the second from `D(1) = ⊤`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.not_isConstant_id`: **the identity is not a constant map on a type with two
  elements**, which is what makes the witness one at a non-constant `σ`.

/-! ### The whole space, transported -/

/-- **Every point lies in `D(1)`, read across an equality of two members.**

`ComplexAnalytic.localisationOpen_one` is the untransported statement.

**Stated at abstract `i` and `j` because that is what makes `subst` available**: at the call site
the equality is between `σ b` and `σ c`, which are terms and not variables, and neither a `rw` of
the untransported form nor a `simp` reaches inside the `▸`. This is the move
`ComplexAnalytic.mem_localisationOpen_coverSpaceHomOfEq` records for the same reason.

**And it is a membership rather than an equality of opens on purpose.** The equality form is the
more natural statement, but discharging the range condition with it needs a `simp only` at a goal
mentioning `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlue` — a definition with proof arguments — and that plants
a `congr_simp` companion for it into this module. Measured: `Δdump` was `+14` for thirteen
declarations and the extra row was `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlue.congr_simp`, on
`Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberDatumGlue.lean`'s definition. In the membership form the condition
closes by `exact` and no tactic traverses the goal. That is
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumRange.lean`'s recorded hazard at a further site, by its own
`simp only` route. -/

/-! ### The two adopted conditions, discharged -/

/-- **The second adopted condition holds, and it is `D(1) = ⊤`.**

`ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumRangeEq` asks the transition's image to land in `D(fam c)` read on the
member `σ b = σ c`; at a family constantly `1` that open is the whole space and there is nothing
left. **This is the condition with no free half**, so it is the one the trivial family is doing
the work for: at any other family it is a statement about where the original cover's transition
goes, and no file on this line proves one. -/

/-- **The first adopted condition holds, and at this `q` it is the free half.**

`ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumRangeCross`'s target is `D(q b c)`, and at
`q b c = poly (σ b) (σ c)` that is `ComplexAnalytic.coverOpen obj poly (σ b) (σ c)` — the open the
three unconditional statements land in. The split is on `σ a` against `σ b` and `σ c`, and the
fourth branch is absent because `σ a = σ b` and `σ a = σ c` force the `σ b = σ c` the condition
excludes.

**Only the third branch reads the original datum's `hrange`**, which is what
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumRange.lean` found and is why this proof has three cases rather
than one. -/
