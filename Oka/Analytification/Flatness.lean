# The germ ring is faithfully flat over the local ring of affine space

**The analytic input to GAGA**, at the origin: writing `𝒪_{𝔸^ι, 0} = ℂ[x]_{(x)}` for the local
ring of affine space and `𝒪_{ℂ^ι, 0} = ℂ{x}` for the ring of germs of holomorphic functions,

```
ComplexAnalytic.faithfullyFlat_polyLocalToGerm :
  (ComplexAnalytic.polyLocalToGerm (ι := ι)).toRingHom.FaithfullyFlat
```

so a system of equations with polynomial coefficients has a convergent solution as soon as it has
a formal one, and an ideal of `𝒪_{𝔸^ι, 0}` is recovered from the ideal it generates in the germs.

## What makes it short, and it is not the local criterion

The classical route to this statement is the local criterion for flatness: a local homomorphism
of Noetherian local rings is flat when the induced map of completions is. **That is not used
here, and it is not needed**, because the two completions are not merely isomorphic — they are
the *same ring*:

* `ℂ⟦x⟧` is the completion of `ℂ{x}` and is **faithfully flat** over it
  (`LocalOkaRing.instFaithfullyFlat`, `Oka/Completion.lean`);
* `ℂ⟦x⟧` is the completion of `ℂ[x]_{(x)}` and is therefore **flat** over it
  (`ComplexAnalytic.flat_polyLocalToMvPowerSeries`, `Oka/Analytification/LocalRing.lean`).

Flatness of `ℂ[x]_{(x)} → ℂ{x}` then follows by descent along the *middle* ring:
`Module.Flat.of_faithfullyFlat_tower` in the mirror tree, which is Mathlib's
`cancelBaseChange` square plus the fact that a faithfully flat extension **reflects**
injectivity. Faithfulness is then free from `Module.FaithfullyFlat.of_flat_of_isLocalHom`, since
both rings are local and the map is local — and *that* is inherited from the completion, where
Mathlib already knows `algebraMap R R̂` is a local hom.

## What is here

* `ComplexAnalytic.polyLocalToGerm`: the map itself, which did not exist before. A rational
  function regular at the origin has a germ, by `IsLocalization.liftAlgHom` and the fact that a
  polynomial not vanishing at the origin is an invertible germ.
* `ComplexAnalytic.coe_polyLocalToGerm`: the triangle — the germ of such a function, read as a
  formal power series, is its Taylor expansion. This is what makes `ℂ[x]_{(x)} → ℂ{x} → ℂ⟦x⟧` a
  scalar tower, which is what the descent consumes.
* `ComplexAnalytic.coe_ofMvPolynomial_zero`: at the origin the germ of a polynomial is the
  polynomial. It is stated here rather than beside `LocalOkaRing.ofMvPolynomial` in
  `Oka/Polynomial/Germ.lean` only because the proof names `LocalOkaRing.coord`, which lives in
  `Oka/MaximalIdeal.lean` and is not in that file's import closure.

## What is *not* here

**Everything is at the origin.** The general-point statement is
`Oka/Analytification/FlatnessAtAPoint.lean`, which deduces it from this one by translating: the
algebraic side by the automorphism `xᵢ ↦ xᵢ + zᵢ`, and the analytic side by the fact that the
germ at `z` of a polynomial is the germ at the origin of the shifted polynomial
(`LocalOkaRing.ofMvPolynomial_taylorAlgHom`).

An earlier version of this paragraph said the analytic side *could not* be translated, because
`LocalOkaRing ι` is the germs at `0` by construction and so there was no germ ring at any other
point to compare with. That was true of the definition and false of the development: `okaStalkEquiv`
identifies the stalk of `𝒪_{ℂ^ι}` at **every** point with `LocalOkaRing ι`, by Taylor expansion
there, and had done so since long before this file was written.

**This is not GAGA**, and it is not the exactness of analytification on coherent sheaves. It is
the local input those arguments consume.
