# The morphism from a cross-member refinement down to the cover it refines

`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumCocycle.lean` ends with
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumAnalytificationOfLaws`, the analytic space a cross-member refined
cover datum glues to, and its `## What is not here` records what is missing next:

> * **Nothing that says the refined cover's analytic space is the original one.** It is a space,
>   and `ComplexAnalytic.not_isIso_refineToBase` says at a constant `σ` that the comparison need
>   not be an isomorphism; **there is no morphism between the two gluings here in either
>   direction.**

**This file supplies one direction of it**, as `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumToBase`. The other
direction is still absent and this file says nothing about it.

## The price two files quote for this is the one-member case's price, and it is not owed here

`Oka/Analytification/CoverIndependence.lean` and `Oka/Analytification/CoverRefinement.lean` both
say a literal `ComplexAnalytic.coverMap` out of a refinement is blocked, and both give the same
reason — that it *"needs `A^an` presented as a one-member cover datum and that gluing identified
with `A^an`, an identification nothing in this repository states"*.

**That is a true statement about `ComplexAnalytic.refineToBase` and a false prediction about this
one.** `coverMap` goes between two *cover data*. The one-member refinement's target is a single
`ComplexAnalytic.Presentation`, so presenting it as a cover datum and identifying the gluing with
its member is exactly what stands in the way there — `refineToBase`'s own docstring says so and
glues the projections instead. **A cross-member refinement's target is
`ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification` of the original datum, which is already a cover datum**, so
neither step exists to be paid and `coverMap` applies with nothing in between. The obstruction was
never about refinement; it was about the shape of the target, and the shape changed when the
refinement did.

## What the instantiation costs, and the two squares were already theorems

`ComplexAnalytic.coverMap` asks for a map of index types, a morphism of presentations over it, and
one geometric hypothesis:

* **`σ`** is the refinement's own index map, unchanged.
* **`ψ`** is `ComplexAnalytic.localisationHom`, whose direction convention is already the one
  `coverMap` wants — `Oka/Analytification/CoverIndependence.lean` records that and records that it
  was measured — and whose source is `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumObj` on the nose, that being an
  `abbrev` for the very `ComplexAnalytic.Presentation` `localisationHom` is declared at.
* **`hcomm`** is `ComplexAnalytic.comm_refineDatumMapPart` below, and it is two theorems this line
  already had, one per branch of the case split on `σ a = σ b`:
  `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumTransitionHom_localisationProj_of_ne`
  (`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumTransition.lean`) puts the refined transition over the
  *original datum's own transition*, which the members' inclusions then absorb by
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverIncl_comp_coverIota`; and
  `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumTransitionHom_localisationProj_of_eq`
  (`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumRange.lean`) puts it over its member across an identification,
  which `ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq_comp_coverIota` absorbs.

**The second of those two absorptions is the only thing the tree did not have**, and it is `subst`
followed by `ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq_refl`. It is in
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumRange.lean` rather than here, under the placement rule
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumCocycle.lean` states; that file's docstring gives the argument.

## `hcomm` holds at every pair and `coverMap` only asks for it at `a ≠ b`

`ComplexAnalytic.comm_refineDatumMapPart` is stated at **every** ordered pair of `B`, with no
`a ≠ b`. That is not a strengthening anybody planned: the hypothesis was written with `a ≠ b` and
the proof never used it, because the case split that runs the proof is on `σ a = σ b` and both
branches are theorems at every pair. `ComplexAnalytic.coverMap` is then fed
`fun a b _ ↦ …`. Nothing below consumes the extra generality; it is recorded because a hypothesis
that turns out to be inert is a fact about the construction and not a tidying detail.

## This is the first `coverMap` whose compatibility is discharged rather than assumed

`Oka/Analytification/CoverFunctoriality.lean`'s `## What is not here` says *"No non-identity
instance. Nothing below exhibits a `σ` and a `ψ` other than the identity."* **That bullet is about
that file and is still true of it**, and the census outside it separates two things a count would
conflate. Outside its home file, `ComplexAnalytic.coverMap` is *applied* by these declarations and
no others — named rather than counted, because a count of the contents of one directory is a dated
claim with no instrument watching it:

* `Oka/Analytification/CoverIndependence.lean` — `ComplexAnalytic.coverMap_hom_inv`,
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverMap_inv_hom`, `ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytificationIso`,
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverMap_reindex_hom_inv`, `ComplexAnalytic.coverMap_reindex_inv_hom`,
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytificationReindexIso`;
* `Oka/Analytification/ComparisonSquare.lean` —
  `ComplexAnalytic.toLRSHom_coverMap_comp_analytificationToSpecGlued`.

**At every one of them `σ` is `id` or an `Equiv` the caller hands over, `ψ` is an isomorphism the
caller hands over, and `hcomm` is a hypothesis.** The only discharge in the repository is
`ComplexAnalytic.comm_coverMapPart_id`, for the identity data.

So what is new here is not "a non-identity `σ`" but **a `σ` that is an arbitrary map of index
types, a `ψ` this repository constructs, and an `hcomm` that is proved** — and of the three it is
the third that was the open question, since the first two are one line each and
`Oka/Analytification/CoverIndependence.lean` had already said so.

## No `rw` here names a definition, and that is measured rather than stylistic

Both proofs below are one step away from the obvious `rw [coverMapPart, …]` and
`rw [refineDatumToBase, …]`, and both spellings were written first. Naming a definition as a
rewrite rule asks Lean to generate its equation lemma, and `scripts/DumpOkaDecls.lean` on that
draft reports **nine** declarations for this branch where it declares seven: the extra two are
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumToBase.eq_1` and `ComplexAnalytic.coverMapPart.eq_1` — and the second
belongs to `Oka/Analytification/CoverFunctoriality.lean`, so this module was adding a lemma to
another file's definition.

`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumRange.lean` and `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumCocycle.lean`
record the same hazard by two other routes, a `simp only` naming nothing and
`CategoryTheory.reassoc_of%`; **this is the third route and the one hardest to avoid by taste,
because naming the definition is what the proof is *about*.** What replaces it is `congrArg` and
`Eq.trans` at the definition's own unfolding, which go through definitional unfolding and generate
nothing. `Δdump` is `+7` for seven declarations, and that equality is the figure to check a branch
on this file by.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumPresHom`: **the `b`-th refined member's morphism down to the member
  it lies over**, which is `ComplexAnalytic.localisationHom` named in this file's vocabulary.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumToBase`: **the morphism from the refined cover's analytic space to
  the original cover's**, which is what this file exists for.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.comm_refineDatumMapPart`: **the members' morphisms agree over the refined
  overlaps** — `ComplexAnalytic.coverMap`'s hypothesis, discharged, at every ordered pair.
- `ComplexAnalytic.coverIota_comp_refineDatumToBase`: **it restricts on the `b`-th refined member
  to that member's projection followed by the inclusion of the `σ b`-th member.** This is the
  statement that says the construction is the intended one rather than a well-typed one; a
  definition ignoring `fam` would satisfy the type and nothing else here.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumToBase_unique`: **and it is the only morphism that does.**

## What is not here

* **No morphism in the other direction, and no claim that this one is an isomorphism.**
  `ComplexAnalytic.not_isIso_refineToBase` is the one-member analogue and it is a *negative* about
  a different morphism; nothing here inherits from it in either direction, and nothing here is a
  conjecture. What would make a comparison an isomorphism is the condition
  `Oka/Analytification/CoverRefinement.lean` names and nobody has stated — that the refining
  family covers — and this file does not state it either.
* **Nothing that says the refined datum covers the original space.**
  `Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberDatum.lean`'s *"No statement that the refined data cover
  anything"* is untouched: a morphism down is not a covering, and the surjectivity of this one is
  not proved, stated, or needed below.
* **No general form taking the refined cocycle law as an argument**, unlike
  `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlueData` beside
  `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlueDataOfLaws`. There would be no such thing to state: the
  **target** is `ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification` of the original datum, which takes that
  datum's own `hcocycle`, so a caller must have it whatever the source is stated at — and with it
  in hand `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumHcocycle` supplies the refined law for nothing. The
  `…OfLaws` spelling is the only one with a caller.
* **No functor law.** That this morphism is compatible with `ComplexAnalytic.coverMap_comp` for a
  refinement of a refinement is not stated, and there is no refinement of a refinement in the
  repository to state it at.
* **No `Spec` side, no scheme and no `admissible`**, as in the files this one sits beside.

/-! ### The member morphism -/

/-- **The `b`-th refined member's morphism down to the member it lies over**, as a morphism of
`ComplexAnalytic.Presentation` in the direction `ComplexAnalytic.coverMap` asks for.

It is `ComplexAnalytic.localisationHom` and nothing else, and the two types match on the nose:
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumObj` is an `abbrev` for
`⟨(obj (σ b)).n + 1, (obj (σ b)).k + 1, localisationPresentation (obj (σ b)).g (fam b)⟩`, which is
the source `localisationHom` is declared at. **An `abbrev` and not a `def`**, so that the
statements below reduce through it without a lemma; it exists to keep
`ComplexAnalytic.coverMapPart`'s arguments readable and carries no content. -/
abbrev refineDatumPresHom (b : B) : refineDatumObj.{u} obj σ fam b ⟶ obj (σ b) :=
  localisationHom.{u} (obj (σ b)).g (fam b)

/-! ### The compatibility over the overlaps -/

/-- **The members' morphisms agree over the refined overlaps**, which is
`ComplexAnalytic.coverMap`'s one hypothesis and the whole content of this file.

The proof is one case split and two squares that already exist. Reading the refined transition down
to `obj (σ b)^an` and then into the glued space:

* at **`σ a ≠ σ b`**, `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumTransitionHom_localisationProj_of_ne` puts it
  over `ComplexAnalytic.coverTransitionHom` of the *original* datum;
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverIncl_comp_coverIota` turns that transition-then-inclusion into the
  `σ a`-th inclusion, and `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumCrossPart_coverIncl` — which says the refined
  overlap included into the `a`-th refined member and projected down is the comparison followed
  into the original overlap — closes it;
* at **`σ a = σ b`**, `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumTransitionHom_localisationProj_of_eq` puts it
  over the `a`-th member across `ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq`, and
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverSpaceHomOfEq_comp_coverIota` absorbs the identification into the
  inclusion.

**There is no `a ≠ b` hypothesis and there was one in the draft.** The split that runs the proof is
on `σ a = σ b`, both branches hold at every ordered pair, and the unused-variable linter is what
reported it. `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumToBase` therefore passes `fun a b _ ↦ …`.

**The `hpart` step is a `congrArg` and not `rw [coverMapPart, …]`**, which would plant an equation
lemma on `Oka/Analytification/CoverFunctoriality.lean`'s definition; the header says what that was
measured at. `ComplexAnalytic.coverMapPart` is an `abbrev` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`'s composition is `⟨f.toLRSHom ≫ g.toLRSHom, _⟩`, so both
unfoldings the step needs are definitional and the term needs no rewrite at all.

**The two `conv_rhs` blocks are not decoration.** `Category.assoc` and its inverse are rewritten by
`rw` at the *first* occurrence, and after the first re-association both sides of the goal carry a
`(f ≫ g) ≫ h`, so an unscoped `rw [← Category.assoc]` moves the left-hand side when the right-hand
side is meant. Scoping the step is shorter than naming the morphism it should fire at. -/

two of the three cost a line.

Stated out of `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumAnalytificationOfLaws` rather than out of the general
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumAnalytification`, and that is not the shape
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumGlueData.lean` and `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumCocycle.lean`
use for their pairs of definitions — see this file's `## What is not here` for why there is nothing

`ComplexAnalytic.coverIota_comp_coverMap` and then
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFunctor_map_localisationPresHom`, which is what turns the functor's
value on `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumPresHom` into `ComplexAnalytic.localisationProj`. **Both steps

`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumToBase` and plants its equation lemma.

is the statement that rules it out. `@[reassoc (attr := simp)]` for the reason
`Oka/Analytification/CoverFunctoriality.lean` gives at the lemma this one rests on: without the
