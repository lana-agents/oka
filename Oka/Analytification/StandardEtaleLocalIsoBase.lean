# A standard étale morphism over a **presented** base analytifies to a local isomorphism

`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleLocalIso.lean` proves this over `ℂ^n` — that is, at `k = 0`,
where the whole of that file sits under one `variable` line. This file proves it over an
arbitrary presented base, at every `k`:

    ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso (analytificationMap (etalePresHom g F G))

with **no** `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationInclHom g` after it. The target is the base's own
analytification `X^an` and not `ℂ^n`, and that distinction is the whole reason this is a theorem
rather than the false statement `Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleLocalIso.lean` records: the
composite *followed by* the inclusion into `ℂ^n` fails at `k ≥ 1` for every `g` whose zero locus
is a proper non-empty closed subset, because a local isomorphism has open image and a proper
closed zero locus has empty interior. **Openness in `X^an` is not openness in `ℂ^n`**, so nothing
in that argument touches the statement above.

## There is no implicit function theorem here, and five files priced one

Five sites said that a statement over a general base *"needs an implicit function theorem relative
to `X^an`, which `Oka/Analysis/Calculus/Implicit.lean` does not have"*. They are about the
projection to `ℂ^n`, which is a different statement and is the false one; the sentence was never
tested against this one. **It takes no analysis at all.** The whole content is that the `k ≥ 1`
configuration is the `k = 0` one restricted over a subspace on both sides, and the transport of
local isomorphisms across such a restriction is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_of_isCutOutBy_pullbackΓ`
(`Oka/AnalyticSpace/CutOutLocalIso.lean`), which is a statement about cut-out data and mentions
no polynomial.

## The route, in the order the declarations come

Write `W₀` for the hypersurface `{F = 0} ⊆ ℂ^(n+1)` — `ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfaceOnly`, which
is `ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfacePresentation` over the **empty** base — and `W` for the `k ≥ 1`
hypersurface `ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfacePresentation g F`.

1. **`W` sits inside `W₀`.** The ideal of `W₀` is contained in that of `W`
   (`ComplexAnalytic.presentationIdeal_hypersurfaceOnly_le`), so
   `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationCompare` gives `ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfaceCompare`, a
   morphism `W^an ⟶ W₀^an` over `ℂ^(n+1)`
   (`ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfaceCompare_comp`).
2. **And it is cut out inside it by the relations of the base, read one variable up.** That is
   `ComplexAnalytic.isCutOutBy_hypersurfaceCompare`, and it is
   `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.of_comp_of_range_eq` — the cancellation lemma — at the two data
   `ComplexAnalytic.isCutOutBy_analytificationInclHom_hypersurface` and
   `ComplexAnalytic.isCutOutBy_analytificationInclHom`, whose families differ exactly by
   `ComplexAnalytic.polyPresentation`.
3. **The open to take is `D(G · ∂F)` and not `D(G)`**, and only on the `W₀` side. On `W₀` the
   derivative hypothesis of
   `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_ofRestrict_comp_proj_of_pderiv` is not available on `D(G)` —
   `ComplexAnalytic.eval_pderiv_ne_zero_of_mem` produces the derivative only at points of `W`,
   which is a proper closed subset of `W₀` — so it is asked on `D(G · ∂F)`, where it holds by
   construction. `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_hypersurfaceOnly_ofRestrict_comp_proj` is that, and
   it asks **nothing of `g`**.
4. **On the `W` side the two opens are the same open.**
   `ComplexAnalytic.localisationOpen_mul_pderiv` says `D(G · ∂F) = D(G)` *in `W^an`*, because
   `ComplexAnalytic.eval_pderiv_ne_zero_of_mem` makes the derivative invertible wherever `G` is.
   **This is what reconciles the two sides**, and it is why nothing here has to compare two
   different open subspaces: one formula, `G · ∂F`, names both, and on `W` it names `D(G)` too.
5. **Then the transport.** `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_ofRestrict_comp_analytificationMap` is
   `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_of_isCutOutBy_pullbackΓ` at `p` the projection of
   step 3, `iX` the base's inclusion into `ℂ^n`, `iY` the restriction of step 2 and `q` the map
   this file is about; its square
   (`ComplexAnalytic.ofRestrict_comp_analytificationMap_comp_analytificationInclHom`) is
   `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationMap_hypersurfacePresHom_comp` and step 1 read together.
6. **And the identification.** `ComplexAnalytic.etaleAnalytificationIso_hom_comp` — an equation
   already in the tree, general in `k` — replaces the étale analytification by `D(G)` in `W^an`
   over the base, and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_comp` closes it.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfaceOnly`: the hypersurface of `F` alone in `ℂ^(n+1)`, as a
  presentation with one relation.
- `ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfaceCompare`: the inclusion of the `k ≥ 1` hypersurface into it.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.presentationIdeal_hypersurfaceOnly_le`: the ideal of `{F = 0}` is contained in
  the ideal of the `k ≥ 1` hypersurface.
- `ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfaceCompare_comp`: **the comparison is a morphism over `ℂ^(n+1)`.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.range_section_hypersurfacePresentation`: the sections cutting out the `k ≥ 1`
  hypersurface are, as a set, the single section cutting out `{F = 0}` together with the relations
  of the base read one variable up.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isCutOutBy_hypersurfaceCompare`: **the `k ≥ 1` hypersurface is cut out inside
  `{F = 0}` by the pullbacks of the relations of the base** — the cancellation, at these
  arguments.
- `ComplexAnalytic.pullbackΓ_proj_ofMvPolynomial`: **pulling a polynomial back along the
  projection `ℂ^(n+1) ⟶ ℂ^n` is reading it one variable up.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_hypersurfaceOnly_ofRestrict_comp_proj`: **`D(G · ∂F)` inside
  `{F = 0}` projects to `ℂ^n` as a local isomorphism**, for every `g`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.localisationOpen_mul_pderiv`: **inverting the derivative as well changes
  nothing on the `k ≥ 1` hypersurface** — the two opens are one open.
- `ComplexAnalytic.restrictSections_hypersurfaceCompare`: the family cutting out the restriction
  is the pullback of the relations of the base along that projection.
- `ComplexAnalytic.ofRestrict_comp_analytificationMap_comp_analytificationInclHom`: the square
  the transport consumes.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_ofRestrict_comp_analytificationMap`: **`D(G · ∂F)` inside the
  `k ≥ 1` hypersurface maps to the base's analytification as a local isomorphism.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.comap_localisationOpen_hypersurfaceCompare`: **that open is `D(G)`** — the
  comparison's preimage of `D(G · ∂F)`, with the derivative deleted by the theorem above.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_analytificationMap_etalePresHom`: **the analytification of a
  standard étale morphism over a presented base is a local isomorphism onto that base**, at every
  `k`.

## What is not here

* **No `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale`.** Unrestricted finiteness at `k ≥ 1` is
  false — `Oka/Analytification/MonicHypersurface.lean` carries the counterexample — and over an
  open subset of the base it is `Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleFiniteness.lean`'s, at `k = 0`.
  The local-isomorphism field is what this file supplies and it is only one of the two.
* **Nothing about the projection to `ℂ^n` at `k ≥ 1`**, which is a different statement and is
  false for a proper non-empty `X^an`;
  `Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleLocalIso.lean` records why and this file does not touch it.
* **No general étale morphism.** Every étale morphism is Zariski-locally standard étale and the
  gluing is a separate construction that nothing starts.
* **No implicit function theorem**, and nothing here consumes
  `Oka/Analysis/Calculus/Implicit.lean`.

The comparison carries a polynomial section of `{F = 0}` to the same polynomial's section of the

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.pullbackΓ_eval₂` reduce that to the coordinates, where it is

/-- **The analytification of a standard étale morphism over a presented base is a local
isomorphism onto that base**, at every `k`.

The statement taxis #1113's comparison functor consumes and the one five files priced as needing
an implicit function theorem. `ComplexAnalytic.etaleAnalytificationIso_hom_comp` — an equation
already in the tree and general in `k` — replaces the étale analytification by `D(G)` in the
hypersurface over the base, `ComplexAnalytic.comap_localisationOpen_hypersurfaceCompare` says
that `D(G)` is the open the transport landed on, and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_comp` composes the result with an isomorphism.

**The target is `X^an` and not `ℂ^n`.** Composed with `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationInclHom g`
this statement is false at `k ≥ 1` for every `g` with a proper non-empty zero locus, which
`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleLocalIso.lean` proves; the two are different theorems and only
this one is about the morphism a cover is. -/
