# The universal property of the analytification of a presented affine `ℂ`-algebra

Fix polynomials `g₁, …, g_k ∈ ℂ[x₁, …, x_n]`. `Oka/Analytification/Presentation.lean` builds the
complex analytic space `X^an = { z ∈ ℂ^n | g₁ z = ⋯ = g_k z = 0 }` and says, in its own module
docstring, that it provides **no universal property**: what it constructs depends on the tuple
`g` and not visibly on the algebra `ℂ[x]/(g)`. This file supplies the mapping property, and with
it the first instalment of presentation-independence.

For every complex analytic space `Z`, morphisms `Z ⟶ X^an` correspond to tuples of global
sections of `𝒪_Z` satisfying the equations:

```
Hom(Z, X^an)  ≃  { a : ULift (Fin n) → Γ(Z, 𝒪_Z) | ∀ j, gⱼ(a₁, …, a_n) = 0 }
```

the correspondence sending `ψ` to the coordinate pullbacks of `ψ` followed by the inclusion
`X^an ↪ ℂ^n`. That is `ComplexAnalytic.existsUnique_hom_analytification`, stated as an `∃!`
rather than as an `Equiv` because the right-hand side is a subtype and the `∃!` is what every
consumer below actually uses.

## The one genuinely new ingredient

**Substitution.** `ComplexAnalytic.Γ_map_comp_ofMvPolynomial` says that pulling a polynomial back
along a `ℂ`-linear morphism `φ : Z ⟶ ℂ^n` is substituting the coordinate pullbacks of `φ` into
it. Both sides are ring homomorphisms out of `MvPolynomial`, so it is `MvPolynomial.ringHom_ext`:
on a constant it is `φ`'s `ℂ`-linearity, and on `Xⱼ` it is `rfl`, because
`ComplexAnalytic.coord j` **is** `OkaRing.ofMvPolynomial ⊤ (X j)` by definition.

This is what converts the geometric hypothesis of the factorisation theorem — *the sections
cutting `X^an` out pull back to zero along `φ`* — into the algebraic equation `gⱼ(a) = 0`, and it
is the reason the mapping property can be *stated* in terms of a tuple of sections rather than in
terms of a morphism to `ℂ^n`. Without it the statement would be a tautology about `IsCutOutBy`.

## The two inputs, and the seam between them that turned out not to exist

* **Surjectivity of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.coordPullback` for an arbitrary `Z`** —
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.exists_hom_complexAffineSpace_general`. Every tuple of global
  sections of `𝒪_Z` is the tuple of coordinate pullbacks of some `Z ⟶ ℂ^n`.
* **The mapping property of `IsCutOutBy` for analytic spaces** —
  `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.existsUnique_liftHom`. A `ℂ`-linear morphism killing the cutting
  sections factors uniquely through the subspace.

The first produces morphisms into `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.complexAffineSpace n`; the
second consumes morphisms into `(complexAffineSpace n).restrict ⊤`, which is a different type.
`ComplexAnalytic.toAmbient` crosses between them along `restrictTopIso`, and the crossing is
free: the sections that have to be carried across are **polynomials**, and a section whose
presentation does not mention the open it lives on crosses definitionally. Both general halves
of the crossing already existed —
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.Γ_map_inv_hom_apply` collapses the round trip for an
arbitrary isomorphism, and `ComplexAnalytic.isCLinearHom_restrictTopIso_inv_constants` supplies
the `ComplexAnalytic.constantsAlgMap` spelling for every `n`.

`ComplexAnalytic.comp_zeroLocusSubspaceι_iff` is where the seam is confined: it says the two
spellings of *"`ψ` is a factorisation of `φ`"* — one through `zeroLocusSubspaceι` and mentioning
`restrictTopIso`, the other through `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationInclHom` and mentioning
neither — are the same condition. Everything downstream is stated in the second spelling.

## What is delivered, and what is not

**Delivered: independence of the chosen generators.** The hypothesis `∀ j, gⱼ(a) = 0` says
exactly that the ideal `(g₁, …, g_k)` is contained in the kernel of `MvPolynomial.eval₂Hom`
(`ComplexAnalytic.eval₂_eq_zero_iff_presentationIdeal_le_ker`), so the functor `X^an` represents
depends on the **ideal** and not on the generating tuple. Two tuples spanning the same ideal —
of possibly different lengths — therefore give canonically isomorphic analytifications:
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationIsoOfPresentationIdealEq`.

**Not delivered, and this file must not be read as providing them.**

* **A change of variables.** Two presentations of the same `ℂ`-algebra may use different numbers
  of variables, and nothing here relates `analytification g` for `g` in `n` variables to
  `analytification g'` for `g'` in `n'` variables. That is the rest of presentation-independence
  and it needs more than this file's `∃!`.
* **Functoriality.** There is no functor from finitely presented `ℂ`-algebras to analytic spaces
  here, and no action on morphisms.
* **The `ℂ`-algebra-hom form of the mapping property.** `AnalyticSpace.algebraMap` is a bare
  `ℂ →+* Γ(Z, 𝒪_Z)` and there is no `Algebra ℂ (Γ(Z, 𝒪_Z))` instance, so the bijection is stated
  against `MvPolynomial.eval₂` throughout rather than against `ℂ`-algebra maps out of `ℂ[x]/I`.
  A Yoneda argument for full presentation-independence would want the latter.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationInclHom`: **the inclusion `X^an ↪ ℂ^n` as a morphism of
  *analytic* spaces**, as opposed to the morphism of locally ringed spaces
  `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationIncl` that `Oka/Analytification/Presentation.lean` provides.
- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationCoord`: the `n` coordinate functions of `X^an`, i.e. the
  coordinate pullbacks along that inclusion. `ComplexAnalytic.nodeCoord` is this at the node.
- `ComplexAnalytic.toAmbient`: a morphism to `ℂ^n`, moved into the `restrict ⊤` presentation of
  `ℂ^n` that `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy` demands.
- `ComplexAnalytic.liftHom`: the morphism `Z ⟶ X^an` the mapping property produces.
- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationIsoOfPresentationIdealEq`: **the analytification of a tuple
  depends only on the ideal it generates.**

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.Γ_map_comp_ofMvPolynomial` and `ComplexAnalytic.Γ_map_ofMvPolynomial`:
  **pulling a polynomial back along a `ℂ`-linear morphism to `ℂ^n` is substituting the
  coordinate pullbacks into it.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.eval₂_analytificationCoord_eq_zero`: **the coordinates of `X^an` satisfy the
  equations**, which is what makes the mapping property's hypothesis meetable at all.
- `ComplexAnalytic.polyToGlobal_eq_eval₂Hom`: the ring map
  `ComplexAnalytic.polyToGlobal` of `Oka/Analytification/Presentation.lean` **is** substitution
  of the coordinates of `X^an`. Nothing new is being built beside it.
- `ComplexAnalytic.existsUnique_hom_analytification`: **the universal property.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.hom_ext_analytification`: two morphisms into `X^an` agreeing on the
  coordinates are equal — the uniqueness half, usable without producing the tuple's `∃!`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isCutOutBy_analytificationInclHom`: **the analytification is cut out of `ℂ^n`
  itself by its defining polynomials** — the zero-locus statement of
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalModel.lean` at the *other* presentation of `ℂ^n`, which is the one
  every consumer of a cut-out datum takes. (Named by file rather than by declaration on purpose:
  this heading is what `scripts/guard_coverage.py` reads, and a name backticked here is counted
  as a result *this* file advertises. The declaration's own docstring names it.)

Both sides are ring homomorphisms out of `MvPolynomial`, so `MvPolynomial.ringHom_ext` reduces
this to the constants and the variables. On a constant it is `φ`'s `ℂ`-linearity, transported
across `AlgHom.commutes`; on `Xⱼ` it is `rfl`, because `ComplexAnalytic.coord j` is by definition
`OkaRing.ofMvPolynomial ⊤ (MvPolynomial.X j)` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.coordPullback φ j` is by definition its pullback.

This is the only genuinely new ingredient of the universal property below: it is what turns *the
cutting sections pull back to zero* into *the equations hold at the tuple*.

/-- **The inclusion of the analytification into `ℂ^n`, as a morphism of complex analytic
spaces.**

`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationIncl` is the same map one category down, as a morphism of locally
ringed spaces; this adds the `ℂ`-linearity, which is what the universal property below has to
quantify over. `ComplexAnalytic.nodeIncl` is this at the node's tuple, definitionally. -/

/-- **The analytification is cut out of `ℂ^n` by its own defining polynomials**, read as
holomorphic functions on `ℂ^n` itself.

`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isCutOutBy_zeroLocusSubspaceι` says this for
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationι`, whose target is `ℂ^n` **presented as an open subspace of
itself**. Every consumer of a cut-out datum in this development takes a morphism into
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.complexAffineSpace n`, i.e. into `ℂ^n` itself, and
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationIncl` is the first composed with `ofRestrict`. This crosses that
`ofRestrict`.

**Nothing general had to be proved for it.** `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.iso_comp`
(`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Restrict.lean`) is the transport along an isomorphism of the target and has
been in the tree since open subspaces were made analytic spaces;
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.restrictTopIso.hom` **is** that `ofRestrict` by definition,
so all that is left is that the family `iso_comp` produces is the one wanted, and
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.Γ_map_inv_hom_apply` collapses the round trip because
`ComplexAnalytic.polySection g j` *is* the pullback of `OkaRing.ofMvPolynomial ⊤ (g j)` along
`restrictTopIso.hom` — the same definitional fact `ComplexAnalytic.c_app_toAmbient_polySection`
below rests on. **The `Γ_map_inv_hom_apply` argument has to be written out** rather than left as
`_`: solving it from the expected type would need `ComplexAnalytic.polySection` unfolded, and
unification does not do that, so the hole is reported as a type mismatch between two spellings
of the same term.

**It is the first cut-out datum this repository produces, rather than assumes, for a morphism of
complex analytic spaces**, which is a sentence six files carried and
`OkaTest/FiniteMorphism.lean` owned. What it does *not* do is produce one for a morphism built by
hand: `ComplexAnalytic.axisIncl` and `ComplexAnalytic.parabolaIncl` are still supplied by
nothing, and those files' bullets say so in their own terms.

The sections are written out rather than given as `ComplexAnalytic.polySection g`, which is the
same tuple at the other presentation of `ℂ^n` and is a different type. -/

`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy` and everything built on it quantify over an open subset of `ℂ^n`,

right-hand side is `gⱼ` evaluated at the coordinate pullbacks of `φ`. Three steps and no
transport: functoriality of `Γ`, then
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.Γ_map_inv_hom_apply` to collapse the `restrictTopIso` round
trip — which is available because `ComplexAnalytic.polySection g j` *is* the pullback of

/-- **The universal property of the analytification of a presented affine `ℂ`-algebra.**

For every complex analytic space `Z`, a tuple `a` of `n` global sections of `𝒪_Z` satisfying the
equations `gⱼ(a) = 0` comes from exactly one morphism `Z ⟶ X^an`, via the coordinate pullbacks
along the inclusion `X^an ↪ ℂ^n`.

Existence: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.exists_hom_complexAffineSpace_general` turns the tuple
into a morphism `φ : Z ⟶ ℂ^n`; `ComplexAnalytic.c_app_toAmbient_polySection` turns the equations
into the vanishing hypothesis of `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.existsUnique_liftHom`; that theorem
factors `φ` through `X^an`. Uniqueness comes from the same `∃!`, transported along
`ComplexAnalytic.comp_zeroLocusSubspaceι_iff`.

/-- **The equations `gⱼ(a) = 0` say exactly that the ideal `(g₁, …, g_k)` lies in the kernel of
substitution.**

This is why the universal property depends only on the ideal: `MvPolynomial.eval₂Hom` is a ring
homomorphism and the `gⱼ` generate, so the condition cannot see the generating tuple. Everything
in this section is a consequence. -/

By uniqueness: the composite and the identity have the same coordinate pullbacks, and
`ComplexAnalytic.hom_ext_analytification` — used here in the shape
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.coordPullback_comp` supplies — says that determines a morphism
into an analytification. Note that the two tuples may have different lengths, so this is not a
statement about reordering a fixed generating set. -/
