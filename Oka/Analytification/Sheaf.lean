# The analytification of a sheaf

For a presentation `g` of a finitely generated `ℂ`-algebra `A`, the comparison morphism
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpec g : X^an ⟶ Spec A` pulls sheaves of modules back:

```
ComplexAnalytic.analytificationSheaf g :
  SheafOfModules (Spec A).ringSheaf ⥤ SheafOfModules (X^an).ringSheaf
```

**This is the functor whose exactness on coherent sheaves is GAGA**, and it is the object that
every account of this development so far has described as missing.

## It was not missing, and there was no design question

`Oka/Analytification/Presentation.lean` and its siblings say that GAGA needs "the analytification
of a *sheaf*", and call it a construction with a design question in front of it — which
pullback, along what, in which category. **Mathlib has the functor.**
`SheafOfModules.pullback` is defined for any morphism of sheaves of rings over a continuous
functor of sites, as the left adjoint of `SheafOfModules.pushforward`, and
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules` uses exactly it to make sheaves of modules functorial for
schemes. Nothing in it is special to schemes.

The one thing that had to be supplied is
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.Hom.toRingSheafHom`, the morphism of sheaves of rings
attached to a morphism of locally ringed spaces. It is Mathlib's
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.toRingCatSheafHom` verbatim, four lines. It is in
`Oka/Geometry/RingedSpace/LocallyRingedSpace/Modules.lean`, next to
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.ringSheaf`, because the two have to agree on how the site
is spelled.

## The obstacle really was a coercion

`ringSheaf`'s site used to be `Opens.grothendieckTopology ↑Y`, and
`TopologicalSpace.Opens.map f.base` produces `Opens.grothendieckTopology ↑Y.toPresheafedSpace`.
The two are definitionally equal and **instance search does not cross them**: Mathlib's
continuity instance for `Opens.map` is not found, and declaring it oneself in the other spelling
does not help, because the discrimination-tree key is built from the elaborated implicit
arguments. With the first spelling `toRingSheafHom` cannot be *stated*.

Re-spelling `ringSheaf` costs four sites and no proof changes; `ringSheaf`'s own docstring records
why it must stay that way.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationSheaf`: **the analytification of a sheaf of modules.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationSheafAdj`: it is left adjoint to pushforward along the
  comparison morphism, which is what determines it.
- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationSheafUnitToUnit`: **the analytification of `𝒪_X` maps
  canonically to `𝒪_{X^an}`** — the map a comparison theorem between the two structure sheaves
  is a statement about.
- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationSheafUnitIso`: **that map is an isomorphism**, so the
  analytification of `𝒪_X` *is* `𝒪_{X^an}`; and `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationSheafFreeIso`,
  the same for a free sheaf on any index type.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.preservesColimits_analytificationSheaf`: **the analytification of a sheaf is
  right exact**, free from the adjunction.
- `ComplexAnalytic.preservesFiniteLimits_analytificationSheaf`: **the analytification of a sheaf
  is left exact** — *GAGA's local half*, and the two together say the functor is exact.

## Exactness, and that no coherence hypothesis appears

**Left exactness is unrestricted.** `preservesFiniteLimits_analytificationSheaf` is stated for all
sheaves of modules on `Spec (ℂ[x] ⧸ I)`, with no finiteness or coherence hypothesis anywhere, and
none of its inputs has one. Coherence is what the classical GAGA *comparison* theorem needs; the
exactness which is its local input is true without it, so the unrestricted form is what is stated
— it is strictly stronger and a consumer can restrict it.

The proof consumes flatness at exactly one place — that `ModuleCat.extendScalars` along
`(analytificationToSpec g).stalkMap y` preserves monomorphisms — and
`Oka/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/PullbackExact.lean` records the measurement that deleting
it breaks that step and nothing else.

## What is not here

* **The comparison theorem.** GAGA proper also asserts that `Hom` and cohomology agree between
  `X` and `X^an` for coherent sheaves. Exactness of analytification is its local input and is a
  strictly smaller statement.
* **Coherence of the image**, which is next door rather than here.
  `Oka/Analytification/SheafCoherent.lean` proves that the analytification of a **cokernel of
  finite free sheaves** is coherent, out of the exactness proved here and Oka's theorem in every
  finite rank. **The statement for a *coherent* sheaf is a corollary of it and is now proved**,
  as `ComplexAnalytic.isCoherent_analytificationSheaf_of_isCoherent`: the bullet that used to
  stand here said it needed a global presentation of the coherent sheaf and that
  `SheafOfModules.IsCoherent.isFinitePresentation` gives only a local one, which was true, and the
  local-to-global passage is
  `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules.exists_isFinite_presentation_of_isCoherent` — algebra on
  `Spec A`, with no analytic input. **The presented form is still the weaker hypothesis and the
  one to apply**; the coherent form is no longer uninhabited, since
  `AlgebraicGeometry.isCoherentStructureSheaf_spec`, and the clause here that said otherwise is
  retired. See `Oka/Analytification/SheafCoherent.lean`.
* **Anything analytic.** Every line here is the `Γ`–`Spec` adjunction and category theory. The
  analytic content is upstream.

/-- **GAGA's local half: the analytification of a sheaf is left exact.**

Together with `ComplexAnalytic.preservesColimits_analytificationSheaf`, which is free from the
adjunction, this says the functor is **exact**.

It is `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.Hom.preservesFiniteLimits_pullbackModules` — pullback
of `𝒪`-modules along a morphism with flat stalk maps is left exact — instantiated at the
comparison morphism, whose stalk maps are faithfully flat by
`ComplexAnalytic.faithfullyFlat_stalkMap_analytificationToSpec`. **That flatness is the only
analytic input**, and it is the only place any flatness is consumed.

There is **no coherence or finiteness hypothesis**; see the module docstring on why the
unrestricted statement is the right one. -/
