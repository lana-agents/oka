# The stalk map of `ℂ^ι ⟶ 𝔸^ι_ℂ` is faithfully flat, at every point

**The analytic input to GAGA.** `Oka/Analytification/Flatness.lean` proves that the germ ring
`ℂ{x}` is faithfully flat over the local ring `ℂ[x]_{(x)}` of affine space **at the origin**, as
a statement about honest rings. This file removes both of that file's restrictions:

```
ComplexAnalytic.faithfullyFlat_polyLocalToGermAt (z : ι → ℂ) :
  (ComplexAnalytic.polyLocalToGermAt z).toRingHom.FaithfullyFlat

ComplexAnalytic.faithfullyFlat_stalkMap_complexSpaceToSpec (z : ι → ℂ) :
  ((complexSpaceToSpec ι).stalkMap z).hom.FaithfullyFlat
```

The first is the statement about honest rings at an arbitrary point `z`; the second is the same
statement about the stalk map of the comparison morphism of locally ringed spaces itself, which
is the form a GAGA argument consumes and which no file in this development could state before.

## The germ ring at `z` is `LocalOkaRing ι`, and that is the whole of the general point

Three files on `master` said, in different words, that a general-point statement needed a
*construction* first, because `LocalOkaRing ι` is the germs at the origin by definition and so
there was nothing at `z` to compare `ℂ[x]_{ker (eval z)}` with. That is true of the definition
and false of the development: `okaStalkEquiv y` (`Oka/StalkEquiv.lean`) identifies the stalk of
`𝒪_{ℂ^ι}` at an **arbitrary** `y` with `LocalOkaRing ι`, by Taylor expansion at `y`, and
`LocalOkaRing.ofMvPolynomial y` is likewise defined at an arbitrary point. The germ ring at `z`
was already there.

What was missing was one lemma, and it is not analysis:
`LocalOkaRing.ofMvPolynomial_taylorAlgHom` says the germ at `z` of a polynomial is the germ at
the origin of the shifted polynomial `p(x + z)`. Together with the fact that shifting the
variables carries the polynomials vanishing at `z` onto those vanishing at the origin
(`MvPolynomial.map_taylorEquiv_primeCompl`), it makes the square

```
ℂ[x]_{ker (eval z)}  ≅  ℂ[x]_{(x)}
        ↓                    ↓
    LocalOkaRing ι  =  LocalOkaRing ι
```

commute, and flatness at `z` is flatness at the origin read through the top isomorphism.
**Translation is affine, not linear, so `Oka/ChangeOfCoordinates.lean` — which handles
`(ι → ℂ) ≃L[ℂ] (κ → ℂ)` — is not what does this.** The translation machinery used is
`TopologicalSpace.Opens.shift` and `OkaRing.shift` of `Oka/StructureSheaf.lean`.

## Crossing to the geometric stalk map

`stalkMap_eq_lift` (`Oka/Analytification/AffineSpace.lean`) already characterises
`(complexSpaceToSpec ι).stalkMap z` as the extension of `LocalOkaRing.ofMvPolynomial z` to the
localisation — a rational function regular at `z` is the germ there of the holomorphic function
it defines. So the only work is to identify the source of that stalk map, which is the stalk of
`Spec ℂ[x]` under `z`, with `ComplexAnalytic.polyLocalAt z`. Both are localisations of
`MvPolynomial ι ℂ` at the same submonoid, so `IsLocalization.ringEquivOfRingEquiv` at
`RingEquiv.refl` does it.

**The transparency trap that `Oka/Analytification/AffineSpace.lean` records does not bite here**,
because that file already restated Mathlib's `Algebra` and `IsLocalization.AtPrime` instances on
the stalk at this concrete point, which is exactly what they were restated for. One thing does
have to be avoided: `Ideal.primeCompl` takes the `Ideal.IsPrime` instance as an argument, so
rewriting with `complexSpaceToSpec_base_asIdeal` inside an `IsLocalization` goal fails on the
motive. `primeCompl_complexSpaceToSpec_base` proves the equality of the two submonoids instead,
which is what `IsLocalization.ringEquivOfRingEquiv` wants and needs no instance transported.

## What is *not* here

**This is not GAGA**, and it is not the exactness of analytification on coherent sheaves. It is
the local input those arguments consume, now available at every point of `ℂ^ι` rather than only
at the origin.

**Nor is it the stalk map of `X^an ⟶ X` for a presented algebra**, which is the map a GAGA
argument for an affine scheme other than `𝔸^ι` actually meets.
`Oka/Analytification/PresentationStalk.lean` identifies that map — as
`IsLocalization.lift` of *"a class in `ℂ[x] ⧸ I` goes to the germ of the holomorphic function it
defines"* — and identifies its **source** as the stalk here modulo `I`
(`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationStalkQuotEquiv`), which with `Module.Flat.quotIdealMap` is two
of the three inputs to its flatness. The third is missing: the identification of the **target**
`𝒪_{X^an, y}` with `LocalOkaRing ι` modulo `I`, which is
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.zeroLocusStalkQuotientEquiv` composed with
`LocallyRingedSpace.restrictStalkIso` and `okaStalkEquiv`, together with the compatibility of the
two identifications with the stalk map.
