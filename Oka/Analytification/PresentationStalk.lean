# The stalk map of `X^an ⟶ X` for a presented affine `ℂ`-algebra

`Oka/Analytification/Presentation.lean` builds the comparison morphism
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpec g : X^an ⟶ Spec (ℂ[x] ⧸ I)` and identifies its map on
*points*. This file identifies its map on *stalks*, which is what a local statement about the
comparison — flatness, and hence GAGA — consumes.

The two ends:

* the **source**, `𝒪_{X, φ(y)}`, is the localisation of `ℂ[x] ⧸ I` at the point underneath `y`,
  and — since localisation commutes with quotients — the localisation of `ℂ[x]` at the point
  underneath `y` in `𝔸^n`, modulo `I`;
* the **map** is the unique extension to that localisation of *"a class in `ℂ[x] ⧸ I` goes to the
  germ at `y` of the holomorphic function it defines"*.

## What this is the analogue of

`Oka/Analytification/AffineSpace.lean` does the same for the ambient comparison morphism
`ℂ^ι ⟶ 𝔸^ι_ℂ`: `complexSpaceToSpecStalk` with its two transported instances,
and `stalkMap_eq_lift`. **Every statement here is that file's statement with a
quotient inserted, and every proof here is that file's proof**, because
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpec` is `complexSpaceToSpec`'s construction
with `ComplexAnalytic.quotientToGlobal` in place of `okaGlobalOfMvPolynomial`.

That is worth saying explicitly, because it is the answer to a question the issue this file
closes flagged as its schedule risk. The `Spec.locallyRingedSpaceObj` transparency problem
measured on taxis #599 — where `isDefEq` times out at a million heartbeats — **does not fire
here either**, for the same reason it did not fire for the ambient map: the `Algebra` and
`IsLocalization.AtPrime` instances are restated at the *concrete point*
`(analytificationToSpec g).base y`, where instance search can key on them, rather than for a
general `PrimeSpectrum`.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpecStalk`: the stalk of `Spec (ℂ[x] ⧸ I)` under a point of
  `X^an`, with Mathlib's `Algebra` and `IsLocalization.AtPrime` instances transported to it.
- `ComplexAnalytic.quotientToGerm`: **a class in `ℂ[x] ⧸ I`, as a germ of a holomorphic function
  on `X^an`.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationStalkQuotEquiv`: **the stalk of `Spec (ℂ[x] ⧸ I)` under `y` is
  the stalk of `Spec ℂ[x]` under `y` modulo `I`.**

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.toStalk_stalkMap_analytificationToSpec`: **the characterising property** — the
  stalk map sends the image of `a` under `toStalk` to the germ of the holomorphic function `a`
  defines.
- `ComplexAnalytic.stalkMap_analytificationToSpec_eq_lift`: **the stalk map is
  `IsLocalization.lift` of `ComplexAnalytic.quotientToGerm`.** This is the analogue of
  `stalkMap_eq_lift` and it is the form a flatness argument consumes: a map out
  of a localisation, with no stalk left in the source.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isUnit_quotientToGerm_iff` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.isUnit_quotientToGerm_of_mem_primeCompl`: a class has invertible germ at `y`
  exactly when it does not vanish there — the hypothesis of the lift.
- `ComplexAnalytic.algebraMapSubmonoid_primeCompl_eq`: the multiplicative set the quotient
  inherits is the one the quotient's own point defines. Stated as an equality of **submonoids**,
  for the reason `ComplexAnalytic.primeCompl_complexSpaceToSpec_base` is.

## What is not here

* **Flatness of this stalk map**, which is what the identifications above are for. It is not
  missing: `Oka/Analytification/PresentationFlatness.lean` supplies the remaining piece — the
  identification of the *target* `𝒪_{X^an, y}` with the germ ring modulo `I`, which is the
  zero locus construction's stalk computation transported across the restriction of `ℂ^n` to
  `⊤` — together with the compatibility of the two identifications with
  the stalk map, and concludes `ComplexAnalytic.faithfullyFlat_stalkMap_analytificationToSpec`.
  **`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationStalkQuotEquiv` is the source half of that argument**, and is
  the reason this file exists in the shape it does.
* **Anything analytic.** The only analytic input used here is
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.evalStalk_ne_zero_iff_isUnit`, i.e. that the residue field of an
  analytic space is `ℂ`; everything else is the `Γ`–`Spec` adjunction and localisation.

/-- **The characterising property of the stalk map**: the image of `a` under `toStalk` goes to the

The stalk of `Spec R` at `p` is the localisation of `R` there, so a ring homomorphism out of it
is determined by its restriction along `toStalk`; this is that restriction.

The proof composes `AlgebraicGeometry.stalkMap_toStalk` for the `Spec` half with
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.toStalk_stalkMap_toΓSpec` for the unit half, and is
`toStalk_stalkMap_complexSpaceToSpec`'s proof verbatim with
`ComplexAnalytic.quotientToGlobal` in place of `okaGlobalOfMvPolynomial`. The
last step uses `congrArg` rather than `rw` because the rewrite is rejected across the
`TopCat.of` transparency seam. -/

multiplicative sets. So this is `IsLocalization.algEquiv` and there is nothing to prove.

The `▸` transports a `Prop`-valued class along an equality of *submonoids*, which is an explicit
