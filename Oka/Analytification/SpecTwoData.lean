# Two cover data over one scheme: the members of the second are affine opens of the first's

`Oka/Analytification/SpecScheme.lean` promotes the gluing of a cover datum to an
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme` and ends with
`ComplexAnalytic.exists_basicOpen_specSchemeIota_inter`, which says that two members of **one**
datum meet in an open distinguished in both. Its own titled section says what that is not:

> it is **not** a common refinement, which needs **two data and an isomorphism of what they glue**,
> **a choice of such an open at every point**, and **the refined family assembled into a cover
> datum with its three laws**.

**This file is the first of those three and the local half of the second.**

## What is new here, and it is not that the data are two

**This is not the first statement in this repository about two cover data, and an earlier draft of
this paragraph said it was.** Four files under `Oka/Analytification/` already open a second cover
datum beside the first, and the second datum is a family of presentations named `obj'` in each:
`Oka/Analytification/SpecFunctoriality.lean`, `Oka/Analytification/ComparisonSquare.lean`,
`Oka/Analytification/CoverFunctoriality.lean` — which opens a third — and
`Oka/Analytification/CoverIndependence.lean`, which opens a second and a third.
`OkaTest/Axioms/Analytification.lean` has guarded statements about a pair of data since
`ComplexAnalytic.coverMap`.

**In every one of them the caller matches the members up before anything is proved, and the
spelling differs.** Three take an index map `σ` together with morphisms
`ψ i : obj i ⟶ obj' (σ i)`; `Oka/Analytification/CoverIndependence.lean` takes **no `σ`** and
matches by the identity on the index type — its `ψ i` is an isomorphism `obj i ≅ obj' i` — and, for
its third datum, by an `Equiv` of index types. What they have in common is the part that matters
here: which member of the second family a member of the first is compared against is fixed in
advance, and nothing there asks whether two members chosen *independently* meet at all.

**Here there is no index map.** The two data are related only by a morphism `Φ` of what they glue;
every pair of members is admissible, `ComplexAnalytic.exists_basicOpen_specSchemeIotaMap_inter` is
stated at an arbitrary `(i, j)`, and `ComplexAnalytic.exists_index_basicOpen_specSchemeIotaMap`
produces both of its indices instead of taking them. **That is the shape a common refinement of two
covers needs and a member-matched comparison does not supply**, and it is what
`Oka/Analytification/CoverIndependence.lean` names as the condition such a refinement has to
reproduce.

**Two drafts of this paragraph were wrong before this one, each because of its sweep, and the pair
is worth more than either repair.** The first claimed to be the first statement about two data at
all; it was checked by a whitespace-normalised search of the *prose* for `two cover data`, and the
thing it is about is a `variable` line — `variable (obj' : K → Presentation.{u})` contains neither
word, so no prose pattern reaches it and all four files above were invisible. **The second
searched the construction and searched for the wrong one**: the pattern was a disjunction, of which
the second alternative matched any file introducing a second *index* type, and two files that
index **cutting polynomials** by one — `Oka/Analytification/CoverRefinement.lean:286` and
`Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberGlue.lean:272`, whose `fam : K → MvPolynomial …` refines a single
member and is taxis #1287's subject — were read as second cover data. Neither contains `obj'`
anywhere. **The instrument that separates them is the name of the construction and not of its
index type**, and the sweep behind the list above is `obj'`, which returns those four files and
this one.

## What is assumed, and it is one morphism

A second cover datum, indexed by a second type `K`, and a morphism

    Φ : specScheme obj' poly' … ⟶ specScheme obj poly …

between what the two glue. **Nothing here produces one.** That two cover data are two covers *of
one scheme* is, in this repository, exactly the statement that such a `Φ` is an isomorphism —
there is no `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme` anywhere on this line except
`ComplexAnalytic.specScheme` itself, so "the same scheme" has to be said this way, and taxis
#1107's thread says it in those words.

**The four declarations below that do not mention a point need only
`AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion Φ`**, which is strictly weaker and costs nothing to state; only
`ComplexAnalytic.mem_opensRange_specSchemeIotaMap` and
`ComplexAnalytic.exists_index_basicOpen_specSchemeIotaMap` ask for `CategoryTheory.IsIso`, and they
ask for it to know that `Φ` is surjective on points.

## The three spellings, recorded so they are not paid twice

1. **`ComplexAnalytic.specSchemeIotaMap` is a composite and nothing else.**
   `AlgebraicGeometry.isAffineOpen_opensRange` then applies to it with no image lemma: the
   `AlgebraicGeometry.IsAffine` side condition is on the *source*, which is a spectrum, so
   carrying a member across `Φ` needs neither `AlgebraicGeometry.IsAffineOpen.preimage_of_isIso`
   nor `AlgebraicGeometry.IsAffineOpen.image_of_isOpenImmersion`.
2. **The open-immersion instance is stated by hand**, for the reason
   `ComplexAnalytic.isOpenImmersion_specSchemeIota` gives at the one-datum spelling: instance
   search does not unfold the definition, and `AlgebraicGeometry.isAffineOpen_opensRange` is the
   consumer that needs one.
3. **Surjectivity of `Φ` is `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.homeoOfIso`** at `CategoryTheory.asIso Φ`,
   not an inverse-composed-with-itself calculation. The calculation was tried first and it fails
   on the *index type*: `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData.ι_jointly_surjective`
   returns a `j` at the glue datum's own `J` field, which is `K` by `rfl` but not syntactically,
   so `rw` on the equation it returns reports a pattern mismatch and then an application type
   mismatch. Destructuring the homeomorphism's surjectivity instead never names the index.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.specSchemeIotaMap`: **the `j`-th member of the second datum, carried into the
  first datum's scheme along `Φ`.**

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.isOpenImmersion_specSchemeIotaMap`: a carried member is an open subscheme.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isAffineOpen_specSchemeIotaMap`: **a member of the second datum is an affine
  open of the first datum's scheme.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.exists_basicOpen_specSchemeIotaMap_inter`: **every point of the overlap of a
  member of the first datum with a member of the second lies in an open distinguished in both.**
  Which Mathlib lemma that is, and why it is not a call to the one-datum statement, are on the
  declaration and deliberately not here: a name in this block is a declaration this file
  advertises, and neither of those two is one.
- `ComplexAnalytic.mem_opensRange_specSchemeIotaMap`: at an isomorphism, the carried members cover.
- `ComplexAnalytic.exists_index_basicOpen_specSchemeIotaMap`: **at every point of the first
  datum's scheme there is a member of each datum and an open distinguished in both containing it**,
  with no index handed in.

## What is not here

* **No common refinement.** The third of the three pieces quoted above — the refined family
  assembled into a cover *datum*, with its `poly`, its `glue` and its three laws — is untouched,
  and nothing here says what it costs. That is the piece taxis #1287 has spent a fortnight on for
  a refinement of **one** datum.
* **No choice.** `ComplexAnalytic.exists_index_basicOpen_specSchemeIotaMap` is an existential at
  each point and not a function on points. A refinement indexes its members by something, and
  choosing that index set is not done here.
* **No polynomial form, and it is the next step rather than a wall.** The two sections it produces
  live in `Γ(X, U)` for the two members `U`, where a cover datum's overlaps are `D(poly i j)` for
  a polynomial in the member's own variables. Two steps close that gap and both were measured
  before this file was written rather than guessed at: `Γ(X, (specSchemeIota … i).opensRange)` is
  `CommRingCat.of (obj i).alg` by `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.appIso` at `⊤` composed with
  `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.ΓSpecIso`, which compiles as one term; and the lift from
  `ComplexAnalytic.PresentedAlgebra` to a polynomial is `Ideal.Quotient.mk_surjective`, which this
  repository already spends at fifteen sites. **Neither is here**, because the first has no
  complex-analytic content and `README.md`'s mirror-tree rule puts it under
  `Oka/AlgebraicGeometry/` rather than in this tree.
* **No consumer of `ComplexAnalytic.exists_basicOpen_specSchemeIota_inter`.** That theorem still
  has none — this file applies the same Mathlib lemma at a different pair of affine opens rather
  than calling it — and taxis #1507 measured that absence rather than asserting it.
* **Nothing that constructs `Φ`**, in either direction, and no statement that two cover data with
  isomorphic gluings have anything else in common.
* **Nothing on the analytic side.** `X^an` is glued from analytic spaces and is not a scheme;
  as in `Oka/Analytification/SpecScheme.lean`, nothing here touches it.
* **No `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.GlueData`**, and no scheme-level glue datum. The gluing stays in
  `Oka/Analytification/SpecAffineCover.lean` at the level of locally ringed spaces.

An `instance` and not a `theorem`, and stated by hand rather than found, for the reason
`ComplexAnalytic.isOpenImmersion_specSchemeIota` gives: instance search does not unfold
`ComplexAnalytic.specSchemeIotaMap`, and `AlgebraicGeometry.isAffineOpen_opensRange` below is a
consumer that needs one. -/

`ComplexAnalytic.isAffineOpen_specSchemeIota` is it at the one-datum spelling: the

no index is handed in, so it is a statement about the two data and not about a chosen pair of

**It is an existential at each point and not a choice.** A common refinement indexes its members
by something, and picking that index set — as well as turning the two sections into polynomials in
the members' own variables — is not here; this module's `## What is not here` says what each of
