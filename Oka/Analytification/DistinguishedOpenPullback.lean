# A distinguished open pulls back along an analytified algebra map to a distinguished open

`Oka/Analytification/ChangeOfVariables.lean` turns a `ℂ`-algebra map of presented algebras
`ψ : ℂ[y] ⧸ J → ℂ[x] ⧸ I` into a morphism `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationMap ψ : X^an ⟶ Y^an`,
and `Oka/Analytification/DistinguishedOpen.lean` attaches to a polynomial `p` of either
polynomial ring the open `D(p)` on which it does not vanish. This file is the one statement
relating the two:

  **`D(p')` upstairs pulls back to `D(p)`, for any `p` representing `ψ` of the class of `p'`.**

A representative always exists, because `Ideal.Quotient.mk` is surjective, so the existential
form `ComplexAnalytic.exists_localisationOpen_eq_comap_analytificationMap` needs no hypothesis at
all: **every distinguished open of the target pulls back to a distinguished open of the source.**

## There is no geometry in it, and that is the point

The proof is two steps and neither is analytic. Pulling a *section* back along a morphism of
analytic spaces multiplies its value at a point by nothing — `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.
nonvanishing_pullbackΓ` says the non-vanishing locus of a pulled-back section is the preimage of
the non-vanishing locus, which is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.eval_c_app` read through
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.mem_nonvanishing_iff`. And the section attached to `p'` pulls back
to the section attached to `p` because `ComplexAnalytic.quotientToGlobal` is natural along the
induced morphism, which is `ComplexAnalytic.Γ_map_analytificationMap_comp_quotientToGlobal`,
proved in `Oka/Analytification/ChangeOfVariables.lean` for functoriality rather than for this.

So the content is the *bookkeeping* between a polynomial, its class in the presented algebra, and
the global section that class names — and the hypothesis is stated on the classes rather than on
the polynomials because that is what the naturality square gives and what a caller holding a
`ComplexAnalytic.PresHom` can check.

## What it is for: the cross-member overlap of a refinement

`Oka/Analytification/AffineCover.lean`'s `poly` field asks for **one polynomial per ordered
pair**, and a refinement of a cover that refines *across* members has to produce one for an
overlap that is cut out inside a localisation and then transported along the cover's own glue
isomorphism. `ComplexAnalytic.exists_localisationOpen_eq_rename` — the previous file — says a
distinguished open of a localisation `(A_f)^an` is always cut out by a renamed polynomial of the
base `A`. What was missing, and is here, is the step before it: that the transported open **is** a
distinguished open of `(A_f)^an` in the first place, which it is because the transport is
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationMap` of an algebra map.

`ComplexAnalytic.exists_comap_analytificationMap_eq_comap_localisationProj` is the two composed,
and it is the form that answer takes: for any `ℂ`-algebra map out of a presented algebra
`(A_f)`-shaped and any distinguished open `D(p')` of its target, the preimage of `D(p')` is the
preimage along the projection of a distinguished open **of the base `A`** — one polynomial, on the
member the refined piece sits in. Taxis #1287 names this as its item (a); nothing here builds a
refinement. Of the remaining two items of that issue, the transport of the original cover's `glue`
through two localisations is `ComplexAnalytic.refineCrossGlue`
(`Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberGlue.lean`), whose extra factor and unit are **arguments**: that
file produces neither, and names the theorem above, with `ComplexAnalytic.exists_mk_rename_eq`,
as where a caller gets them. **The two geometric laws across members are still untouched.** The
datum those two would be laws of now has one field —
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumPoly` (`Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberDatum.lean`), its `poly`, whose
extra factor is the `q` the theorem above produces — and no other; its `glue`, `hrange`, `hsymm`
and `hcocycle` are as untouched as the two laws are.

## Non-vacuity

Every statement here is an equation of open subsets, so all of them hold of `⊤ = ⊤` and none of
them says anything about a space it cannot see. Two readings would empty them and
`OkaTest/DistinguishedOpenPullback.lean` closes both: that the preimage might always be the whole
space, and that the map might always be one whose value on opens is already known.
`comap_localisationOpen_nodeStructureHom_ne_top` exhibits a proper preimage — `D(z₁)` on the node
pulled back to the localisation at `z₀`, where it misses the point `(1, 0, 1)` — and
`localisationOpen_rename_of_comap` re-derives `ComplexAnalytic.localisationOpen_rename` from the
theorem below at `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresHom`, which is a check that the general
statement specialises to the one that was proved by hand.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.pullbackΓ_analytificationMap_polyToGlobal`: **the section attached to `p'`
  pulls back to the section attached to any representative of `ψ` of its class.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.localisationOpen_eq_comap_analytificationMap`: **`D(p)` is the preimage of
  `D(p')`**, the statement above read on opens.
- `ComplexAnalytic.exists_localisationOpen_eq_comap_analytificationMap`: the same with the
  representative produced rather than supplied — **every distinguished open pulls back to one.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.exists_comap_analytificationMap_eq_comap_localisationProj`: **out of a
  localisation, that preimage comes from a distinguished open of the base** — the bullet above
  composed with the previous file's converse, that every distinguished open of a localisation is
  the preimage of one downstairs. `## What it is for` above names that one, in the spelling that
  produces the polynomial rather than the open.

## What is not here

* **Anything about a cover.** `ComplexAnalytic.coverOpen` and the refinement it is for live four
  files further on; the statements below mention a `ComplexAnalytic.PresHom` and a polynomial and
  nothing else.
* **The functor.** `Oka/Analytification/Functor.lean` bundles `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationMap`
  as `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFunctor`, and a caller holding an isomorphism of
  `ComplexAnalytic.Presentation` reaches these statements through
  `ComplexAnalytic.Presentation` composing with `Functor.map`, which is `analytificationMap` by
  definition. This file imports only the two it names, in the manner of
  `Oka/Analytification/LocalisationFunctor.lean`'s own account of why it is a separate file.
* **Any converse.** Nothing says a preimage of a *general* open is distinguished, and nothing
  says the polynomial the existential produces is unique — it is not, since `D` sees only the
  non-vanishing locus (`ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentationIsoOfDvdPow` is the statement one
  file over that records this at the level of presentations).

The hypothesis of `ComplexAnalytic.localisationOpen_eq_comap_analytificationMap` can always be
met, because `Ideal.Quotient.mk` is surjective: a class has a representative, and this is that
theorem with the representative produced rather than supplied. It is the form a caller obliged to
hand a *polynomial* to a cover datum needs, and the reason the hypothesis-carrying form is stated
first is that the polynomial such a caller already holds is rarely the one `Classical.choice`
would produce. -/

/-- **Out of a localisation, the preimage of a distinguished open comes from a distinguished open
of the base** — one polynomial, on the member the localisation sits in.

`ComplexAnalytic.exists_localisationOpen_eq_comap_analytificationMap` says the preimage is a
distinguished open of `(A_f)^an`, and `ComplexAnalytic.exists_localisationOpen_eq_comap` says
every distinguished open of `(A_f)^an` is the preimage of one of `X^an`. Two existentials
composed, and the second is the whole content of the previous file.

**This is the arity statement a refinement across members needs**, and it is stated here rather
than in the vocabulary of a cover because nothing in it is about a cover: `ψ` is any `ℂ`-algebra
map out of a presented algebra of the shape `ComplexAnalytic.localisationPresentation` produces,
and `p'` is any polynomial of its target. What a caller does with `Q` — feed it to
`ComplexAnalytic.coverOpen`, having first met it with the polynomial cutting out the overlap it
started from — is not this file's business. -/
