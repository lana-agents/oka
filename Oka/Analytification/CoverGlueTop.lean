# A cover whose members overlap in the whole of themselves glues to one member

`Oka/Analytification/AffineCover.lean` glues an affine cover with distinguished overlaps, and
`OkaTest/AffineCover.lean` checks that the gluing of its three copies of the node is **not** any
one of them — `ComplexAnalytic.ι_nodeOrigin_ne`, from the origin lying off the punctured axis.
That check is about a cover whose overlaps are proper. **This file is the opposite extreme**: if
every off-diagonal `ComplexAnalytic.coverOpen` is `⊤`, then each member's inclusion into the
gluing is surjective, and — being also an open immersion — an isomorphism.

## Why this is a `⊤` and not a `⊥` statement, and why it is worth having

The two degeneracies this development has already named are about the *refining family*: at
`fam ≡ 1` the refined cover is the original one reindexed
(`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumWitness.lean`), and at `fam ≡ 0` every refined member is empty
(`OkaTest/CoverRefinement.lean`). **Neither is about the overlaps**, and a cover can be
non-degenerate in both of those senses and still glue to one member, because what decides that is
whether the members overlap in the whole of themselves rather than what they are.

`ComplexAnalytic.coverOpen obj poly i j = ⊤` says exactly that, and the argument from it is short:
the inclusion `f i j` of the overlap into the `i`-th member is `ComplexAnalytic.coverIncl`
preceded by an `eqToHom`, so it is surjective; then any point of the `j`-th member is `f j i` of
something, and `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData.ι_eq_iff` identifies it with a point
of the `i`-th.

**So the pair of checks this line has been treating as a non-degeneracy test does not test for
this, and that is worth stating as a property of the checks rather than of any one instance.** A
refinement is customarily checked here by two statements about the refined *member*: that
`D(fam b)` is not the whole of its original member (so the refinement is not the reindexing at
`fam ≡ 1`) and that it is not empty (so it is not the family constantly `0`). **A cover can pass
both and still glue to one member**, because those two say nothing about the *overlaps*; the check
that would catch it is the third one, that the refined overlap is not the whole refined member,
and it is a different statement from either. `OkaTest/RefineDatumWitness.lean` states that third
one at `fam ≡ 1`; the two proper refinements in this repository state the first two and not the
third, and the theorem below is why.

## The `eqToHom`, which is where the `CategoryTheory.GlueData'` route shows

`ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData` is `CategoryTheory.GlueData.ofGlueData'` of
`ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData'`, and `ofGlueData'` fills the diagonal with the member itself. So
`f i j` off the diagonal is `CategoryTheory.GlueData.ofGlueData'_f_of_ne`'s `eqToHom` followed by
the overlap's inclusion, and `ComplexAnalytic.f_coverGlueData_of_ne` below is the general form of
what `OkaTest/AffineCover.lean` proves by hand for one cover. That theorem applies to a *refined*
datum too, since `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlueData` is `coverGlueData` at the refined
arguments — the `CategoryTheory.GlueData'` it needs is solved from the goal and does not have to
be named.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.f_coverGlueData_of_ne`: **the inclusion of an overlap into a member is
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverIncl` preceded by an equality coercion**, at every cover datum.
- `ComplexAnalytic.surjective_f_coverGlueData`: **and it is surjective when that overlap is the
  whole member.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.surjective_ι_coverGlueData`: **each member's inclusion into the gluing is then
  surjective.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.isoCoverGlued`: **so the gluing is that member**, up to isomorphism.

## What is not here

* **No converse.** Nothing says that a cover which glues to one member has all its overlaps `⊤`;
  a two-member cover of a space by two copies of itself along a proper open would be a
  counterexample if one existed on this line, and none is exhibited either way.
* **Nothing about the analytic structure.** `ComplexAnalytic.isoCoverGlued` is an isomorphism of
  locally ringed spaces, which is what `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData` produces;
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification`'s `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` structure is obtained
  from the same gluing, so the isomorphism transports along
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification_toLocallyRingedSpace`, but no such transport is stated.
* **`ComplexAnalytic.surjective_base_eqToHom` is in the wrong file and is here on a price.** It is
  a fact about `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace` and nothing else, and belongs beside
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.homeoOfIso` in
  `Oka/Geometry/RingedSpace/LocallyRingedSpace.lean`. That file has **175 downstream modules** in
  this repository against **86** for a new module under `Oka/Analytification/`, measured by a
  reverse walk of the `import` lines, so putting a three-line helper there costs about ninety
  extra module rebuilds. Moving it is a follow-up and this docstring is the record that it is
  owed.
* **No scheme, no `admissible`, and no comparison functor**, as in the files this one sits beside.

/-! ### The inclusion of an overlap into a member -/

/-- **The inclusion of an overlap into a member is `ComplexAnalytic.coverIncl` after an
`eqToHom`**, off the diagonal.

`CategoryTheory.GlueData.ofGlueData'_f_of_ne` at `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData'`, and the
`eqToHom` is there because `CategoryTheory.GlueData.ofGlueData'` fills the diagonal with the
member itself, so its `V` is a `dite`.

**The `CategoryTheory.GlueData'` is left as `_` and the elaborator solves it from the goal.**
`OkaTest/AffineCover.lean` names its own because it states `CategoryTheory.GlueData'.f'`, where an
index would be checked against a projection of a metavariable; that difficulty is at that position
and not at this one. This is the general form of that file's `ComplexAnalytic.f_nodeTripleGlueData`
and applies to a **refined** datum as well, since `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlueData` is
`ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData` at the refined arguments. -/

    (coverGlueData.{u} obj poly glue hrange hsymm hcocycle).toGlueData.f i j =
      eqToHom (dif_neg hij) ≫ coverIncl.{u} obj poly i j :=
  CategoryTheory.GlueData.ofGlueData'_f_of_ne _ hij

/-- **And it is surjective exactly where the overlap is the whole member.**

`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.range_ofRestrict` says the image of
`ComplexAnalytic.coverIncl` is the overlap; the hypothesis makes that the whole space, and
`ComplexAnalytic.surjective_base_eqToHom` handles the factor in front. -/
theorem surjective_f_coverGlueData
    (htop : ∀ i j : J, i ≠ j → coverOpen.{u} obj poly i j = ⊤) {i j : J} (hij : i ≠ j) :

    exact hy
  rw [f_coverGlueData_of_ne obj poly glue hrange hsymm hcocycle hij, LocallyRingedSpace.comp_base]
  exact hincl.comp (surjective_base_eqToHom _)

/-! ### The gluing is then one member -/

/-- **Each member's inclusion into the gluing is surjective**, when every off-diagonal overlap is
the whole member.

`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData.ι_jointly_surjective` puts an arbitrary point of
the gluing in some member `j`; if `j = i` there is nothing to do, and otherwise the point is
`f j i` of some `z'` by the theorem above, and `t j i` carries `z'` to a point of the `i`-`j`
overlap whose two images are related by
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData.ι_eq_iff`. The step that makes the second
component come out is `CategoryTheory.GlueData.t_inv`, which undoes the transition. -/

    (htop : ∀ i j : J, i ≠ j → coverOpen.{u} obj poly i j = ⊤) (i : J) :

      (Ne.symm hij) y
    refine ⟨(D.toGlueData.f i j).base ((D.toGlueData.t j i).base z'), ?_⟩
    rw [LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData.ι_eq_iff]
    refine ⟨(D.toGlueData.t j i).base z', rfl, ?_⟩
    rw [LocallyRingedSpace.comp_base]
    change (D.toGlueData.f j i).base
      ((D.toGlueData.t i j).base ((D.toGlueData.t j i).base z')) = y
    have h : (D.toGlueData.t i j).base ((D.toGlueData.t j i).base z') = z' := by
      rw [← ConcreteCategory.comp_apply, ← LocallyRingedSpace.comp_base, D.toGlueData.t_inv j i]
      simp
    rw [h, hz']

/-- **So the gluing is one member.**

`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion.isoOfRangeEq` against the identity: the
member's inclusion is an open immersion at every cover datum
(`ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData_ι_isOpenImmersion`) and the theorem above makes its image the
whole gluing.

**This is the degeneracy `ComplexAnalytic.ι_nodeOrigin_ne` rules out for the node cover**, stated
in the direction that exhibits it rather than the direction that forbids it. -/
