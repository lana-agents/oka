# A standard étale morphism over affine space analytifies to a local isomorphism

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimpleZeroTopology.lean` proves that an open subspace of a hypersurface in
`ℂ^(n+1)`, on which a polynomial cutting it out has non-vanishing derivative in the last
variable, projects to `ℂ^n` as a local isomorphism of complex analytic spaces
(`ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_ofRestrict_comp_proj_of_pderiv`).
`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleAnalytification.lean` proves that the analytification of a
standard étale presentation **is** such an open subspace — the distinguished open `D(G)` of the
hypersurface `{F = 0}` — and that `StandardEtalePair.cond` supplies exactly that derivative
hypothesis there (`ComplexAnalytic.eval_pderiv_ne_zero_of_mem`). This file joins the two, and it
is the first module to import both subtrees.

## The base is `ℂ^n`, and that is the statement rather than a limitation of the proof

`ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfacePresentation g F` is `Fin.snoc (polyPresentation g) F`: the `k`
relations of the base algebra read upstairs, and `F`. The theorem above takes a cut-out datum for
**one** section, and `Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleAnalytification.lean` recorded the
mismatch as a missing datum for `k + 1` relations against one section.

**It is not a missing datum.** The conclusion of that theorem is about the projection to `ℂ^n`,
and for `k ≥ 1` it fails — **whenever the base's analytification `X^an` is a proper closed subset
of `ℂ^n`** — unless the hypersurface's analytification is empty. **This sentence gave the reason
as *"since its image is contained in `X^an`"*, and that reason is a step short**: containment in a
proper closed subset is not on its own incompatible with being a local isomorphism, and this
file's `## What is not here` says in terms that *"a local isomorphism need not be surjective and
this one is not"*. What closes it is that the image is **open**. A local isomorphism is a local
homeomorphism — that is the field
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso.isLocalHomeomorph` — and so an open map, hence its image
is open; a proper closed `X^an ⊆ ℂ^n` has empty interior, since `X^an` is the zero locus of the
relations of `g` and a polynomial vanishing on a non-empty open subset of `ℂ^n` is zero; and an
open subset of a set with empty interior is empty. **So the two sentences are not in tension**:
non-surjectivity is exactly what makes the containment reading fail, and openness is what makes
the corrected one work.

*Unless empty* rather than a bare *false* because the empty case is not a counterexample: both
fields of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso` quantify over the points of the source, so an
empty analytification satisfies them vacuously.

**Since 2026-09-02 this paragraph is a theorem and not only an argument.**
`ComplexAnalytic.not_isLocalIso_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp`
(`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleNotLocalIso.lean`) is the failure above, compiled, with the two
qualifications restated so that they are checkable: *proper* becomes `∃ j, g j ≠ 0`, which is what
makes the zero locus a proper subset and is what the proof consumes, and *unless empty* becomes a
`Nonempty` on the source. **The argument above is not the proof's.** The proof does not pass
through the interior of `X^an`: having the image open and inside the zero locus, it applies
`MvPolynomial.eq_zero_of_eval_eq_zero_of_isOpen` (`Oka/Algebra/MvPolynomial/Funext.lean`) to make
every relation zero, which contradicts `∃ j, g j ≠ 0` at once. The two routes are the same three
facts in a different order and the paragraph is kept as written because it is the one a reader
meets here; **and it is kept as a paragraph rather than replaced by a citation**, for the reason
the section below gives about the two copies of it.

**Both hypotheses are met together at the node**, so the theorem is not vacuous:
`ComplexAnalytic.not_isLocalIso_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp_node`
(`OkaTest/StandardEtaleNotLocalIso.lean`), where the same standard étale data **is** a local
isomorphism onto the base's own analytification and is not one onto `ℂ²`. That is this paragraph's
distinction exhibited rather than argued.

***Proper* is a hypothesis at `k ≥ 1` and not a consequence of it, which is why the clause above
carries it rather than leaving it to be read out of the argument.** Nothing constrains `g`:
`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleAnalytification.lean`, where the `k ≥ 1` configuration is
written down, takes it under a `variable` line that asks nothing of it. At `g = 0` the relations
cut out nothing, `X^an` is the whole of `ℂ^n`, its interior is everything, and the argument has no
step left — and `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationInclHom g` is then a local isomorphism rather
than a closed immersion onto a proper subset. That configuration is degenerate and nothing on
this line calls it, but the clause is a claim about **every** `g` at `k ≥ 1`, and a reader who
tests it there finds it false rather than unmotivated.

**This argument is written out twice, as two copies and not as one citation, and that is
deliberate.** The other copy is `Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleAnalytification.lean`'s
`## What is not here`. Each sits inside a section about something else — there a misdiagnosed
absence, here why the base is `ℂ^n` — so a citation would send a reader to a paragraph whose
subject is not the one they came for. Both are kept, **each names the other**, and a repair to
one is not made without the other.

The `k + 1` versus one is the signature of a statement whose base is the whole of `ℂ^n`, i.e.
`k = 0`, and that is what everything below is stated at. A statement over a general base is a
different theorem. **This sentence went on to price that theorem — *"needs an implicit function
theorem relative to `X^an`, which `Oka/Analysis/Calculus/Implicit.lean` does not have"* — and the
pricing was a misdiagnosis in both directions**, which the two paragraphs below say in full: of
the two statements at `k ≥ 1` the projection one is **false** rather than expensive, and the
other takes no implicit function theorem relative to `X^an` at all.

**That sentence is about the projection to `ℂ^n`, and at `k ≥ 1` there are two statements and not
one.** The other is about the analytified structure map to `X^an` **alone**, without
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationInclHom g` after it:
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso (analytificationMap (etalePresHom g F G))`. It is a
different statement, and the argument above does not touch it — that argument concludes from the
image being an open subset of a proper closed subset **of `ℂ^n`**, and openness in `X^an` is not
openness in `ℂ^n`. **It is now a theorem** —
`ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_analytificationMap_etalePresHom`
(`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleLocalIsoBase.lean`), at every `k` — and *"a statement over a
general base"* above should be read as naming the projection one only, which is the one that is
false. **It is also not obtained by cancelling** the composite against
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_of_comp`, whose second factor would have to be
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationInclHom g` — a closed immersion, and by the argument above not a
local isomorphism whenever `X^an` is a proper non-empty closed subset of `ℂ^n`, since its image is
the whole of `X^an` and a local isomorphism has open image. **Neither qualification follows from
`k ≥ 1`**: at `g = 0` the image is the whole of `ℂ^n` and this morphism is a local isomorphism,
and at a `g` with the constant `1` among its relations the source is empty and it is one
vacuously.

**That other statement takes no implicit function theorem relative to `X^an` — only the one
relative to `ℂ^n` that everything below already spends — and this is measured rather than
read.** `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_of_isCutOutBy_pullbackΓ`
(`Oka/AnalyticSpace/CutOutLocalIso.lean`) transports the class from a local isomorphism
`p : E ⟶ B` to any morphism between subspaces cut out of `E` and of `B` by a family of sections
and by its pullbacks along `p`, and `Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleLocalIsoBase.lean` supplies
the two cut-out data and the commuting square at these arguments. **Nothing analytic enters those
three**: the datum for the smaller space is a cancellation of cut-out data
(`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.of_comp_of_range_eq`), and the one place a naive transcription of
the `k = 0` proof breaks is the open — `ComplexAnalytic.eval_pderiv_ne_zero_of_mem` supplies the
derivative only on the `k ≥ 1` hypersurface, so the `k = 0` side is stated at `D(G · ∂F)` and
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationOpen_mul_pderiv` says that names `D(G)` on the `k ≥ 1` side. **What
is analytic is the fourth input** — that the projection of `D(G · ∂F)` is itself a local
isomorphism, which is `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_ofRestrict_comp_proj_of_pderiv` and is this
file's own input at `k = 0`, spent again and not spent twice.

At `k = 0` the two families agree on the nose: `ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfacePresentation g F` is
a `Fin 1`-family whose only entry is `F`, and
`ComplexAnalytic.section_hypersurfacePresentation_empty` is the one line that says so. The datum
itself is `ComplexAnalytic.isCutOutBy_analytificationInclHom`
(`Oka/Analytification/UniversalProperty.lean`), which holds for every `k` and needed no new
general lemma: `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.iso_comp` was already in the tree.

## What the last theorem's target is, and why it is `ℂ^n`

`ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp` concludes about
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationMap` of the étale structure map **followed by the inclusion of
the base's analytification into `ℂ^n`**, and not about the structure map alone. At `k = 0` the
inclusion `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationInclHom g` is an isomorphism — the zero locus of the
empty family is everything — but **nothing in this repository says so**; see `## What is not
here`. Composing with it is therefore not a weakening but a choice of spelling: the target is the
`ℂ^n` that `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.proj` maps to, named as itself.

The step that makes that composite the right one is
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationMap_hypersurfacePresHom_comp`
(`Oka/Analytification/HypersurfaceFinite.lean`), which says the analytified structure map
followed by the base's inclusion is the hypersurface's own inclusion followed by the projection.
It holds for every `k` and is the only thing this file takes from that module.

## `localisationVar` and `Fin.last`

`ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_ofRestrict_comp_proj_of_pderiv` differentiates at
`ULift.up (Fin.last n)` and `ComplexAnalytic.eval_pderiv_ne_zero_of_mem` produces a derivative at
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationVar n`. **They are the same term** —
`Oka/Analytification/DistinguishedOpen.lean` defines the second as the first — so the statements
below are written with `ComplexAnalytic.localisationVar` throughout and no bridge lemma appears
anywhere. A reader comparing the two signatures will otherwise go looking for one.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.section_hypersurfacePresentation_empty`: over an empty base presentation, the
  polynomials cutting the hypersurface out of `ℂ^(n+1)` are the one-element family `![F]`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isCutOutBy_analytificationInclHom_hypersurface`: **so the hypersurface's
  analytification carries a cut-out datum for a single section**, which is what every theorem on
  this line asks for.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_hypersurface_ofRestrict_comp_proj`: **`D(G)` inside the
  hypersurface `{F = 0} ⊆ ℂ^(n+1)` projects to `ℂ^n` as a local isomorphism**, given that the
  derivative of `F` in the last variable does not vanish on `D(G)`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_hypersurface_of_standardEtale`: the same with the derivative
  hypothesis discharged from `StandardEtalePair.cond`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp`: **the analytification of a
  standard étale morphism over `ℂ^n` is a local isomorphism onto `ℂ^n`.**

## What is not here

* **No `IsFiniteEtale`, and this file moves the finiteness field nowhere.** For the *unrestricted*
  standard étale morphism finiteness is **false** — inverting `G` destroys it, and
  `Oka/Analytification/MonicHypersurface.lean`'s `## What is not here` carries the counterexample
  in terms. So the two fields of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale` are not two halves
  of one job here: one of them is a theorem and the other is a false statement waiting for a base
  restriction that nothing below constructs.

  **The base restriction is now constructed, in a file that imports this one's imports and not
  this one**: `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp`
  (`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleFiniteness.lean`) makes the étale analytification finite over
  an open `V ⊆ ℂ^n` on which the inversion is vacuous. **And the step that paragraph named as
  missing has since been taken.** It said the class
  would be wanted for
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictHom (… ≫ analytificationInclHom g) V`, whose `IsFinite`
  field is that theorem and whose `IsLocalIso` field would follow from the last theorem below **if
  `IsLocalIso` transported along `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictHom`** — and that it was
  a general fact about open subspaces rather than anything this line owns. Both readings held:
  the transport is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_restrictHom`
  (`Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenSubspace.lean`), which reads nothing about étale morphisms, and the
  class is `ComplexAnalytic.isFiniteEtale_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp`
  (`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleFiniteEtale.lean`). **The last theorem below is its second
  field and is read unrestricted** — the restriction is asked for by the first field alone,
  because unrestricted finiteness is false and unrestricted local-isomorphy is not.
* **Nothing at `k ≥ 1`**, for the reason at the top of this docstring: not a gap but a different
  statement.
* **Nothing saying `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationInclHom g` is an isomorphism when `g` is the
  empty family**, and the price is measured rather than guessed.
  `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.uniqueIso` against
  `ComplexAnalytic.isCutOutBy_id_restrict_top` gives the isomorphism of *locally ringed* spaces,
  and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.forgetToLocallyRingedSpace` is faithful but not full, so the
  inverse would still have to be shown `ℂ`-linear before the conclusion could be moved to
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.analytification g`. **It is not built here because nothing
  consumes it**: the last theorem below is a complete statement with `ℂ^n` as its target, and the
  thing that would want the other spelling is the assembly of the Riemann existence theorem, not
  this file.
* **No `StandardEtalePair` is constructed *here*, and this bullet's own count of what is
  constructed elsewhere was wrong in both of its halves.** It said *"no `StandardEtalePair` is
  constructed anywhere"* and that `ComplexAnalytic.eval_pderiv_ne_zero_of_mem` *"has been on
  `master` without a witness since it landed"*; **both were already false the day this file
  landed.** `ComplexAnalytic.condPair` (`OkaTest/StandardEtaleCond.lean`) arrived a day earlier
  and `ComplexAnalytic.eval_pderiv_condF_condHyperPoint_ne_zero` is that theorem applied at it, so
  the `cond` route through the two theorems below is checked there and not by nothing. There are
  three more: `ComplexAnalytic.sqSubOnePair` (`OkaTest/OpenBaseFiniteness.lean`),
  `ComplexAnalytic.sqSubOneTwoPair` (`OkaTest/StandardEtaleLocalIsoBase.lean`), and
  `ComplexAnalytic.sqrtCoverPair` (`OkaTest/StandardEtaleBaseWitness.lean`), the last a family
  over an arbitrary `ℂ`-algebra. **What survives is the placement and it is what the bullet is
  for**: the two theorems below inherit that hypothesis rather than discharging it, and this file
  adds no new unwitnessed one. `OkaTest/StandardEtaleAnalytification.lean` exercises the
  *derivative* form instead, on the line `z₁ = 0` in `ℂ²` with `z₀` inverted, where the derivative
  is `1` and no pair is needed.

  **The bullet was invisible to any sweep of `Oka/`, and that is the transferable part.** It is an
  absence scoped to *anywhere* whose refutation lives under `OkaTest/`; nothing under `Oka/`
  imports `OkaTest/`, so the claim is true of this file's import closure and false of the
  repository, and a grep of the library cannot see the difference.
* **Nothing about the image.** A local isomorphism need not be surjective and this one is not:
  the witness in the test library misses the origin. No statement below says anything about the
  image, about fibres, or about degree.
* **Nothing about a general étale morphism.** Every étale morphism of schemes is Zariski-locally
  standard étale; gluing the statement below over such a cover is a separate construction and
  nothing here starts it.

/-! ### The cut-out datum for a single section -/

/-- **Over an empty base presentation the hypersurface is cut out of `ℂ^(n+1)` by `F` alone.**

`ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfacePresentation g F` is `Fin.snoc (polyPresentation g) F`, so at
`k = 0` it is a `Fin 1`-family and its only index is `Fin.last 0`. The `change` names that index —
`fin_cases` leaves the goal at `(0 : Fin 1)` and `Fin.snoc_last` is stated at `Fin.last`, which
is the same element and not the same term.

**`change` and not `show`, and `lake build --wfail` is what says so.** Mathlib's
`linter.style.show` rejects a `show` that *alters* the goal — which is the whole point of this
one — and the build turns that warning into a failure. The two tactics do the same thing here.

The `show … from Fin.snoc_last _ _` inside the `rw` is a different `show`, is a term and not a
tactic, and is untouched by that linter. It is the shape
`ComplexAnalytic.eval_pderiv_ne_zero_of_mem` uses one file over, **and here it is a choice rather
than a necessity**. This paragraph said it was forced, for the sibling's reason: that a bare
`rw [hypersurfacePresentation, Fin.snoc_last]` fails with *"Failed to rewrite using equation
theorems for `hypersurfacePresentation`"*, and that naming the instance is what keeps an equation
lemma for that definition out of the environment. **Neither holds at this rewrite**, measured in
tree: the bare form compiles, and `scripts/DumpOkaDecls.lean`'s output is byte-identical either
way, so no equation lemma enters the environment on either spelling. The sibling states its
version of the reason at `Fin.snoc_castSucc` under `rwa … at`, which is a different rewrite and
is untouched here; the named form is kept for consistency with it and for nothing else. -/

/-- **The analytification of a standard étale morphism over `ℂ^n` is a local isomorphism onto

The statement the whole of this line was for, at the one base the theorems it rests on are about.
Read the composite as a whole: `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationMap` of
`ComplexAnalytic.etalePresHom` lands in the base's analytification, and
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationInclHom` names that as a subspace of `ℂ^n` — which at `k = 0` it
is the whole of, though nothing here proves that; see `## What is not here`.

Three rewrites and an instance. `ComplexAnalytic.etaleAnalytificationIso_hom_comp` replaces the
étale analytification by `D(G)` in the hypersurface, over the base;
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationMap_hypersurfacePresHom_comp` turns the remaining map to the base
followed by the base's inclusion into the hypersurface's inclusion followed by the projection;
and then the composite is an isomorphism followed by the theorem above, which
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_comp` closes.

**`haveI` for both, and that is emphasis rather than necessity.**
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_comp` is an instance and needs the two facts as local
instances to fire, which a plain `have` supplies as well: the proof compiles unchanged with
`have` twice, measured in tree. This paragraph also called that *"the same reason
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_of_isIso` is a `theorem` and not an instance — its own
docstring says why"*; that docstring explains a discrimination-tree seam in its own proof and
says nothing about instance-versus-theorem, so the citation is withdrawn rather than replaced. -/
