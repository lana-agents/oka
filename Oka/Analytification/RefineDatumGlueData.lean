# The refined cover datum's glue data: `hrange` assembled, and `hcocycle` named

`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumTransition.lean` and `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumRange.lean`
settle the range law of a cross-member refined cover datum at each of the five ways the three
members `σ a`, `σ b`, `σ c` of a triple of *different indices* can coincide. That is five
statements and not one law, and `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData` takes one: `hrange` is a single
`∀ i j k`, and `ComplexAnalytic.coverTriple` takes a *proof* of it as an argument, which is why
the cocycle law could not so much as be stated while the range law was five separate theorems.

**This file joins them, and the joining is where the hypothesis a caller carries gets decided.**

## Two conditions and not one, which is `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumRange.lean`'s finding

Four of the five shapes are equivalences, and their right-hand sides are of two shapes:

* at the three triples with `σ b ≠ σ c` the residue is the containment in the caller's own
  `D(q b c)` that `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumTransition.lean` isolated, and it is the *same*
  containment whichever branch `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlue` takes at `(a, b)` and wherever
  the free half came from — `ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumRangeCross` below;
* at `σ b = σ c` the law asks for a containment in `D(fam c)`, which belongs to the caller's
  refining family and not to the original datum, and there is no free half at all —
  `ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumRangeEq` below.

So the assembled hypothesis is a pair, and **the second half of it is asked for only where
`σ a ≠ σ b`**: at an all-equal triple the law is
`ComplexAnalytic.range_refineDatumTransitionHom_subset_of_eq`, a theorem with no hypothesis on
the caller's `q` and none on the original datum's own `hrange`, and asking a caller for something
already proved would misstate what this construction costs.

**And the pair is necessary as well as sufficient**
(`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumHrange_iff`). Each shape statement is an equivalence rather than an
implication precisely so that this direction is available, and without it the file would have
adopted a hypothesis without saying that no weaker one can do.

## What is left, and it is one law with a name

With `hrange` a single proof, `ComplexAnalytic.coverTriple` applies at the refined datum and the
cocycle law becomes statable: `ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumCocycle`. Naming it is most of what
this file is for. `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlueData` and
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumAnalytification` then take it as their one remaining hypothesis, the
symmetry law being `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlue_symm` and the range law being the theorem
above — so of the three laws a cross-member refinement needs, one was **already proved** before
this file, one is **proved here from two conditions this file adopts and shows equivalent to it**,
and the third is **named here and proved in the file that consumes this one.** Neither geometric
law was available at a non-constant `σ` before this file; the symmetry law was, and bringing all
three together is what `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlueData` is.

**Nothing here is evidence about the cocycle law**, and this paragraph gave a reason that was on
record and wrong: *"the cancellation `Oka/Analytification/CoverRefinement.lean` uses at a constant
`σ` is against the projection of the one fixed member, and at a general `σ` there is no one fixed
member to project to"*. There is — the member the triple's first index lies over —, and
`ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumHcocycle` (`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumCocycle.lean`) proves the
law from the original datum's own three. **Nothing here is still evidence about it**: that file
consumes this one and reopens nothing in it.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumRangeCross`: **the residue of the range law wherever
  `σ b ≠ σ c`**, one condition for three shapes.
- `ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumRangeEq`: **the whole of the range law where `σ b = σ c` and
  `σ a ≠ σ b`**, which is a containment in the caller's own refining family.
- `ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumCocycle`: **the cocycle law of the refined datum**, statable
  because the range law is now one proof — and proved, in
  `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumCocycle.lean`, which is what this name being writable was for.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumGlueData`: **the glue data of the refined cover** at a general
  `σ`, with the cocycle law as its one hypothesis.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumAnalytification`: **the analytic space it glues to.**

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumHrange`: **`hrange` for the refined cover datum**, the five shapes
  joined, in the form `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData` takes.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumHrange_iff`: **and the two conditions are exactly what it asks** —
  the law is equivalent to their conjunction, so no weaker pair will do.
- `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumAnalytification_toLocallyRingedSpace`: **the analytic space's
  underlying locally ringed space is the glue data's gluing**, with no transport.

## What is not here

* **`ComplexAnalytic.RefineDatumCocycle` is named and not proved *here*.** This bullet said it
  was proved nowhere and that nothing on this line was evidence about it in either direction;
  `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumHcocycle` (`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumCocycle.lean`) proves it,
  from the original datum's own three laws, and the hypothesis-free forms of the two definitions
  below are there. Nothing in *this* file is evidence about it, which is what the bullet is now
  saying.
* **Nothing that discharges either adopted condition.** Whether
  `ComplexAnalytic.exists_refineDatumCross`'s choice satisfies `RefineDatumRangeCross`, and
  whether a caller can arrange `RefineDatumRangeEq`, are untouched here in both directions; this
  file adopts, and `Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberGlue.lean`'s record that nothing produces `q`
  stands.
* **No witness.** There is still no example of a refined cover datum at a non-constant `σ`, which
  is taxis #1107's fourth deliverable; a construction whose hypotheses nobody has met is not one.
* **None of the five shapes is reproved.** `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumRange.lean` and
  `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumTransition.lean` are consumed and not opened.
* **The scheme side, `admissible`, and the comparison functor**, as in the files this one sits
  beside.

/-! ### The two conditions the range law reduces to -/

/-- **The residue of the refined range law wherever `σ b ≠ σ c`**: the transition, read down on
the member it lies over, lands in the caller's own `D(q b c)`.

**One condition for three of the five shapes**, which is
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumRange.lean`'s finding and is not obvious in advance: the free
half differs between them — the original datum's own `hrange` at a pairwise different triple, the
unconditional half of the transition law at `σ a = σ c`, the source's own second overlap at
`σ a = σ b` — and the residue does not differ at all, including on the equal branch. -/

/-- **The whole of the refined range law where `σ b = σ c`**, which is a containment in
`D(fam c)` and not a residue: the target there belongs to the caller's refining family, so no
half of it is free and the original cover's geometry bears on it not at all.

**It is asked for only where `σ a ≠ σ b`, and that asymmetry is deliberate.** At
`σ a = σ b = σ c` the law is `ComplexAnalytic.range_refineDatumTransitionHom_subset_of_eq`, a
theorem with no hypothesis on `q` at all, so quantifying this condition over every `a` would ask
a caller for something already proved and would misstate what the construction costs. -/

/-- **`hrange` for the refined cover datum, at a general `σ`**, in the exact form
`ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueData` takes it.

The case split is on `(σ a, σ b, σ c)` and it is exhaustive and disjoint: the all-equal triple is
a theorem, the two mixed ones with `σ b ≠ σ c` and the pairwise different one are the first
condition, and `σ b = σ c` with `σ a ≠ σ b` is the second. **Note which hypotheses each branch
spends**: the original datum's own `hrange` is read at the pairwise different triple and nowhere
else, and the two conditions are read at four of the five shapes and not at the fifth. -/

/-- **And the two conditions are exactly what the refined law asks**, so no weaker pair will do.

The four shape statements are equivalences and this is their `.1` directions collected; the
all-equal triple contributes nothing, since neither condition is quantified there. **It is what
makes the previous theorem an assembly rather than a strengthening**: a file that adopts a
hypothesis owes the statement that it adopted no more than the law, and
`ComplexAnalytic.range_refineDatumTransitionHom_subset_iff` set that standard on this line and
gave its reason. -/

/-! ### The cocycle law, and the glue data -/

/-- **The cocycle law of the refined cover datum**, and this is the first file in which it can be
written down.

`ComplexAnalytic.coverTriple` takes a proof of `hrange` as an argument and this statement mentions
it three times, so it is not one case away from anything the five shape statements say: it needs
the range law as a *single* proof, which is `ComplexAnalytic.refineDatumHrange` above and nothing
earlier. Which proof is immaterial — the law is a `Prop` and any two proofs of it are
definitionally equal — but that there is one is the whole of the obstruction that stood here. -/
