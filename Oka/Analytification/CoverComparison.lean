# The comparison morphism `X^an ⟶ X` for a glued scheme

`Oka/Analytification/Comparison.lean` builds the comparison morphism of a *presentation*,
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpec g : A^an ⟶ Spec A`, and makes it natural.
`Oka/Analytification/AffineCover.lean` glues the analytifications of a family of presentations
into `X^an`, and `Oka/Analytification/SpecAffineCover.lean` glues their `Spec`s into `X`. **This
file is the morphism between the two gluings**, glued from the members' comparison morphisms.

## What the construction costs, and it is one hypothesis and two naturality squares

`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData.glueMorphisms` maps out of a glue datum's gluing
into any locally ringed space, given a family out of the members agreeing over the overlaps. So
once `X` exists — which is what `Oka/Analytification/SpecAffineCover.lean` supplies — the whole
content of this file is that

```
analytificationToSpec (obj i).g ≫ specIota i
```

is such a family, and **that is two instances of one naturality square**. Both are
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpecNatTrans`, which has been in the tree since
`Oka/Analytification/Comparison.lean`:

* at `ComplexAnalytic.localisationHom`, which says the comparison commutes with passing to a
  distinguished open — `ComplexAnalytic.coverIncl_comp_analytificationToSpec` below;
* at `(glue i j).hom`, which says it commutes with the transition —
  `ComplexAnalytic.comparisonPart_comp_specTransition` below.

Nothing else about the comparison morphism is used. In particular no property of
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpec` beyond naturality enters, and neither does any of
`Oka/Analytification/AffineCover.lean`'s second half.

## The input asks for two range hypotheses and two cocycle hypotheses, over one datum

`ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification` and `ComplexAnalytic.specGlued` are built from **the same**
family of presentations, the same polynomials and the same `glue`, and `hsymm` is a hypothesis on
`glue` alone and so is literally shared. `hrange` and `hcocycle` are not: `hrange` is a statement
about the ranges of base maps, and the analytic side's members are non-vanishing loci in `ℂ^n`
where the `Spec` side's are basic opens of a spectrum. `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpec` is
not a homeomorphism between them, so nothing transports. `hcocycle` is stated through whichever
side's triple-overlap morphisms it is about.

**So a caller supplies four hypotheses over one datum, and the two extra ones are the price of
having both spaces.** `OkaTest/ProjectiveLine.lean` pays it for `ℙ¹` and the price there is zero:
both triple-overlap hypotheses are vacuous below three members, on both sides and for the same
reason, so the `Spec`-side pair is the same one-line elimination the analytic pair already was.

## `ComplexAnalytic.comparisonPart` is the reason the two squares compose

The family's compatibility is an equation over the *overlaps*, and the overlap has two
descriptions on each side — as `Spec`/analytification of the presentation
`ComplexAnalytic.coverOverlap`, and as an open subspace of the ambient member.
`ComplexAnalytic.comparisonPart` is the comparison morphism of that presentation read through
both identifications at once, and it is what lets the naturality square at
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationHom` — which is stated at the presentation — be used against
`ComplexAnalytic.coverIncl`, which is stated at the open subspace. Without it the two squares are
about different objects and do not compose.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.comparisonPart`: the comparison morphism at an overlap, read through
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverOverlapIso` and `ComplexAnalytic.specOverlapIso`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.comparisonPartIota`: the `i`-th member's contribution to the glued morphism,
  `A_i^an ⟶ Spec A_i ⟶ X`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpecGlued`: **the comparison morphism `X^an ⟶ X`**, which is
  what this file exists for.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.coverIncl_comp_analytificationToSpec`: **the comparison commutes with passing
  to a distinguished open of a member**, in the vocabulary of the two cover files.
- `ComplexAnalytic.comparisonPart_comp_specTransition`: **and with the transition.** These two are
  the naturality squares, and between them they are the whole content of the compatibility.
- `ComplexAnalytic.comm_comparisonPartIota`: **the members' comparison morphisms agree over the
  overlaps**, which is `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData.glueMorphisms`' hypothesis
  in the form a caller can supply it.
- `ComplexAnalytic.toLRSHom_coverIota_comp_analytificationToSpecGlued`: **it restricts to the
  affine comparison on each member.** This is the statement that says the construction is the
  intended one; a definition ignoring its input would satisfy the type and nothing else here.
- `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpecGlued_unique`: **and it is the only morphism that does.**

## What is not here

* **No `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme`.** `ComplexAnalytic.specFunctor` lands in
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace` and `ComplexAnalytic.specGlued` is a gluing of such, so
  `X` is a locally ringed space here and the comparison morphism is one of locally ringed spaces.
  `Oka/Analytification/Comparison.lean` and `Oka/Analytification/AffineCover.lean` each argue in a
  titled section that the absence of `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme` from their statements is a
  *result*; **this file does not weaken either, and it did not have to** — nothing in the
  construction wanted one, since `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData.glueMorphisms`
  maps into an arbitrary locally ringed space.
* **No source at the analytic-space level.** `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpecGlued` is
  stated out of `(coverAnalytification …).toLocallyRingedSpace`, not out of
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification` itself, because its target is not an analytic space and
  there is no morphism of analytic spaces to be had. `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueMorphisms` is the
  declaration for the case where the target *is* one; it is not applicable here and that is why
  this file goes through the glue datum directly. The two agree on the source:
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverAnalytification_toLocallyRingedSpace` is `rfl`.
* **No comparison of the two covers' opens.** That
  `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpecGlued` carries `ComplexAnalytic.coverOpen` into
  `ComplexAnalytic.specOpen` is a statement about the cover rather than about the morphism, and
  nothing below needs it. `Oka/Analytification/SpecAffineCover.lean` makes the same point.
* **No statement that the comparison is an isomorphism, or flat, or anything else.** Those are
  theorems about `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpec` and belong wherever that is studied;
  this file glues, and gluing preserves nothing on its own.
* **No functoriality.** `Oka/Analytification/CoverFunctoriality.lean` — a morphism of covered
  schemes analytified — is a different construction and does not pass through here. That the
  square between the two commutes is stated in neither file.

`ComplexAnalytic.localisationIso` pushed through the forgetful functor, and
`ComplexAnalytic.coverIncl` is the inclusion of the open subspace, so their composite is

It is `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpec` of the presentation
`ComplexAnalytic.coverOverlap` — the one object the two cover files share — read through
`ComplexAnalytic.coverOverlapIso` at the source and `ComplexAnalytic.specOverlapIso` at the
target. **Naming it is what makes the two naturality squares compose**: the square at
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationHom` is stated at the presentation and the square at `(glue i j).hom`
is stated at the presentation too, while the compatibility this file needs is stated at the open
subspaces, and this is the morphism the two spellings meet in. -/

/-- **The comparison commutes with passing to an overlap.**

The first of the two naturality squares, in the cover files' vocabulary:
`ComplexAnalytic.toLRSHom_localisationProj_comp_analytificationToSpec` with
`ComplexAnalytic.coverOverlapIso_hom_coverIncl` on the analytic side and
`ComplexAnalytic.specLocalisationIso_hom_ofRestrict` on the `Spec` side.

The `show` in the proof is doing one thing and it is worth a sentence: it applies
`ComplexAnalytic.specLocalisationIso_hom_ofRestrict` at the `ComplexAnalytic.specOverlapIso`
spelling **without** `rw [specOverlapIso]`, which would plant an equation lemma on another file's
definition. Nothing would break if it did — `scripts/check_docstring_names.py` has excluded
generated components since lana-agents/oka#261, which is the branch that stopped an `rw` on a
definition in one file from turning off the field-notation rule for that definition's field
citations in every other — but the two spellings are definitionally equal, so the equation lemma
buys nothing, and one `show` avoids leaving the tree a name it did not ask for. Measured when
this file was written: with the `rw` the environment carries
`ComplexAnalytic.specOverlapIso.eq_1` and the file adds one declaration more than it does without
it — eighteen against seventeen at the time, and it is the *difference* that is the point, since
the level moves whenever anything else in the file does. -/

`ComplexAnalytic.coverIota` rather than at the glue datum's own `ι` — the same choice
`ComplexAnalytic.isOpenImmersion_coverIota` makes, and for the same reason: a statement spelled at
the glue datum's `ι` is a statement about a gluing wearing `X^an`'s name.
`ComplexAnalytic.toLRSHom_coverIota` is the `rfl` that makes the two spellings interchangeable.

**This is the statement that says the construction is the intended one**: everything else here is
true of a morphism that ignores the family it is glued from.

**It is `@[reassoc]` and deliberately not `@[simp]`**, which is a consequence of that choice of
spelling rather than an oversight: `ComplexAnalytic.toLRSHom_coverIota` is itself a `simp` lemma,
so this left-hand side rewrites to the glue datum's `ι` and is not in simp-normal form. **Measured
rather than asserted** — with `@[simp]` planted here and nothing else changed, `lake lint` reports
it and names the lemma that does the rewriting:
