# The chosen family is an affine open cover, and it refines both data

`Oka/Analytification/SpecRefinedChoice.lean` ends at
`ComplexAnalytic.exists_family_opensRange_presentationRefinedIota_eq`: given two cover data and an
isomorphism `Φ` of what they glue, there are four functions on the points of the glued scheme `X`
— a member of each datum and a polynomial in each member's own variables — such that at every
point the two chosen refined members are **the same affine open of `X`**, and the first family's
supremum is `⊤`.

**This file assembles that family into an object.** The two theorems below say that the two cover
data admit a common refinement by an affine open cover of `X`: one exhibits the cover with the
presentation of every member named on both sides, and the other states the containment that the
word *refinement* ordinarily means.

## The index type, and the sentence this file corrects

`Oka/Analytification/SpecMemberChoice.lean`'s `## What the index type is` is the standing statement
on this line and reads, in part, that *"a refinement indexed by points is not a refinement anybody
would assemble — the assembly step chooses a set of opens and an index type for it … and that
choice is not made here."*

**That is right about a cover *datum* and wrong about a cover, and the difference is what this file
turns on.** `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.AffineOpenCover` is `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.AffineCover` at
`AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion`, and its index type is an arbitrary `Type`: it carries a
choice function `idx` from the points of the scheme to that index type and a field asking that
every point lie in the range of the component `idx` names. **So the points of `X` are a legal index
type, the identity is a legal choice function, and that field is the second half of the choice
step's own conclusion** — no set has to be chosen and no index type has to be invented.

**What a cover datum needs and this does not supply is `poly` and the three laws**, together with
the condition `Oka/Analytification/SpecScheme.lean` names: every pairwise overlap must be a
distinguished open of *each* of the two members it lies in. That is the third of that file's three
pieces and none of it is here, which is the reason this file's title says *cover* and not *cover
datum*.

**The condition is not uniformly out of reach, and which half is out of reach is worth stating.**
Where two members of the cover below are chosen inside **one** member of a datum — which many
pairs are, the index type being the points of `X` and `idx` sending many of them to one member —
the overlap is a chosen open of that member again, at the product of the two polynomials, by
`ComplexAnalytic.opensRange_presentationRefinedIota_inf`. Where they are chosen inside
**different** members it is what the points of `X` cannot give, and that is the half the third
piece is against.

## What the two statements are, and why there are two

The first names the presentation of every member of the cover on both sides — each is
`ComplexAnalytic.presentationRefinedIota` of a member of the respective datum at a polynomial in
that member's own variables — so a reader gets the affine opens *and* the data cutting them out.
The second says only that every member of the cover is **contained in** a member of each datum,
which is the ordinary definition of one cover refining another. **The second is the first plus
`ComplexAnalytic.opensRange_presentationRefinedIota_le` and is four lines**; it is stated
separately because a caller who wants the refinement statement should not have to read four bound
functions to find it.

**Both are existentials over the cover and not definitions of one**, for the reason
`Oka/Analytification/SpecMemberChoice.lean`'s `## Existential over four functions` section gives of
the four functions it declines to define: nothing distinguishes one choice from another, so a
`def` would name an arbitrary member of a class and every later statement would carry the
arbitrariness anyway. A consumer that wants the cover recovers it from either statement with one
`obtain`.

## Two elaboration facts, recorded because each cost a compile

* **The universe on `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.AffineOpenCover` has to be written.** Its index type
  lives in a universe the rest of the statement does not pin, so the spelling below is
  `.AffineOpenCover.{u}`; without it the index field fails with *"has type `Type u` … but is
  expected to have type `Type u_1`"*.
* **The covering field is discharged by the choice step's own second conjunct after one rewrite.**
  Membership in the set-range of a component and membership in its
  `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.opensRange` are definitionally the same, so no bridge lemma is
  needed and none should be added.

`scripts/guard_coverage.py` reads every whitespace-free backticked token under a `## Main results`
heading as a declaration this file advertises, so the Mathlib names, the file paths and the
projection spellings above are here rather than under the heading below.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.exists_affineOpenCover_opensRange_presentationRefinedIota_eq`: **two cover data
  and an isomorphism of what they glue admit a common refinement by an affine open cover of the
  glued scheme**, every member of which is a chosen distinguished open of a member of each datum,
  with the presentations named.
- `ComplexAnalytic.exists_affineOpenCover_opensRange_le`: **and every member of that cover is
  contained in a member of each datum**, which is the ordinary sense in which one cover refines
  another.

## What is not here

* **No cover datum.** No `poly`, no `glue`, and none of the three laws, so nothing here is or
  produces a common refinement *of two cover data*. That is
  `Oka/Analytification/SpecScheme.lean`'s third piece and taxis #1287's line, and this file adds to
  none of `Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberDatum.lean`,
  `Oka/Analytification/CrossMemberDatumGlue.lean` or the `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatum*.lean`
  files. **The title says *cover* for that reason and the module name does too**: this is not a
  common refinement in the sense the enclosing programme is after.
* **Nothing small, and nothing finite.** The cover produced below is indexed by the points of `X`,
  so it is as large as `X`; no set of opens is cut down and no subcover is extracted.
  `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.OpenCover.finiteSubcover` needs the space to be compact, and
  `ComplexAnalytic.specScheme` is not known to be and in general is not, its index type being
  arbitrary.
* **Nothing that constructs the isomorphism `Φ`**, in either direction. It is a hypothesis here
  exactly as it is in `Oka/Analytification/SpecTwoData.lean`, and nothing in this repository
  produces one.
* **No new mathematics about the opens themselves.** Both statements are the imported choice step
  repackaged; the affineness of every member is
  `ComplexAnalytic.isAffineOpen_presentationRefinedIota` and is not restated here, since the
  spectrum of the presented algebra is the source of every component of the cover and Mathlib's
  own instance reads it off.
* **Nothing analytic.** No analytification, no `X^an`, no comparison morphism: everything here is
  on the `Spec` side.

/-- **Two cover data and an isomorphism of what they glue admit a common refinement by an affine
open cover of the glued scheme**, with the presentation of every member named on both sides.

The cover's index type is the points of `X`, its choice function is the identity, and its covering
field is the second conjunct of
`ComplexAnalytic.exists_family_opensRange_presentationRefinedIota_eq`'s source, which says that
every point lies in its own chosen open. **That is the whole construction**: the components are
the chosen refined members of the first datum, and the equation below is the choice step's first
conjunct rewritten into the vocabulary of ranges.

**The first conjunct is `rfl` at the cover built here and is not `rfl` for a reader**, which is why
it is stated. The statement quantifies over a cover, so from outside nothing says how the
components were chosen; both conjuncts together are what identify the components as refined
members of the two data, and either alone would leave one of the data unmentioned.

**The second conjunct is the one that mentions the second datum.** Its immersion is
`ComplexAnalytic.specSchemeIotaMap … Φ (idx' b)`, which is not
`ComplexAnalytic.specSchemeIota` of anything in the first datum — the reason
`ComplexAnalytic.presentationRefinedIota` takes an arbitrary open immersion. -/

/-- **And every member of that cover is contained in a member of each datum** — the ordinary sense
in which one cover refines another.

The theorem above with `ComplexAnalytic.opensRange_presentationRefinedIota_le` applied to each of
its two conjuncts. **This is the statement to cite for *refinement*** : it mentions no polynomial,
no presentation and no chosen function, so a caller who wants only that the two data have a common
affine refinement reads one existential and two containments.

**It is weaker than the theorem above in exactly one way and stronger in none**: the containment
forgets which distinguished open of the member the component is, which is the content the other
statement keeps. Nothing here says the containments are proper, and at a polynomial that is a unit
they are equalities. -/
