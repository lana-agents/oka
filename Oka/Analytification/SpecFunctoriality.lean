# A morphism of covered schemes on the `Spec` side

`Oka/Analytification/SpecAffineCover.lean` glues the members' `Spec`s into `X`, and
`Oka/Analytification/CoverFunctoriality.lean` builds `X^an ⟶ Y^an` from a map of index types and
a morphism of presentations over it. **This file is the same construction on the other side**:
the same input gives `X ⟶ Y`, with the identity and composition laws.

## It is the analytic file with the promotion step removed

**Every declaration here that has a counterpart in `Oka/Analytification/CoverFunctoriality.lean`**
is that counterpart with `ComplexAnalytic.specFunctor` where that file has
`ComplexAnalytic.analytificationFunctor`, and every difference between a pair is a *subtraction*:

* **No `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom.toLRSHom` anywhere.** The analytic file states its
  compatibility hypothesis at the locally-ringed-space level because
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueMorphisms` does, and then has to push its family through the
  forgetful functor. `X` is a locally ringed space to begin with, so the whole file works at one
  level — the same saving `Oka/Analytification/SpecAffineCover.lean` records about itself.
* **No wrapper around `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData.glueMorphisms`.**
  `ComplexAnalytic.coverGlueMorphisms` exists because a glued locally ringed space has to be
  promoted into an analytic space and the glued morphism has to be shown `ℂ`-linear;
  `ComplexAnalytic.specGlued` **is** the glue datum's gluing, so `glueMorphisms` and
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData.hom_ext` apply to it directly and
  `ComplexAnalytic.specMap_unique` is one line.

**The qualification is carrying exactly one declaration, and the count says so: nine here against
eight there.** The extra is `ComplexAnalytic.comm_specGlueData`, which is an addition and not a
mirror, and the next section is about where its counterpart does live.

## `ComplexAnalytic.comm_specGlueData` is here and not in `Oka/Analytification/SpecAffineCover.lean`

Its analytic mirror `ComplexAnalytic.comm_coverGlueData` lives in
`Oka/Analytification/AffineCover.lean`, under that file's `### Morphisms out of \`X^an\`` heading —
and `Oka/Analytification/SpecAffineCover.lean` deliberately mirrors only the *first* half of that
file, saying in terms that the second half exists to promote a gluing into an analytic space and
so does not transfer. Nothing there needed a family out of the members. **This file is the first
thing that does**, so the bridge from the compatibility a caller can state to the one a glue
datum's `glue_condition` has belongs here, beside its only consumer.

## The input, and why the compatibility is a hypothesis

Unchanged from the analytic side, and for the same reason: nothing in a map of index types and a
family of morphisms of presentations implies that the members agree over the overlaps of `X`. A
morphism of schemes need not carry one cover into the other, and even when it does, which member
of the target's cover an overlap of the source lands in is a choice `σ` does not record.
`ComplexAnalytic.comm_specMapPart_id` discharges the hypothesis for the identity data, so it is
meetable; `ComplexAnalytic.comm_specMapPart_comp` discharges it for a composite, so the
composition law asks a caller for nothing beyond the two hypotheses its two morphisms carry.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.specMapPart`: the `i`-th member's contribution, `Spec A_i ⟶ Y`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.specMap`: **the induced morphism `X ⟶ Y`.**

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.comm_specGlueData`: **agreement over the chosen overlaps is the glue datum's
  compatibility condition**, which is what makes everything below statable.
- `ComplexAnalytic.specIota_comp_specMap`: **it restricts to `Spec` of the member morphism on each
  member.** It is the only statement here *about `ComplexAnalytic.specMap`* with independent
  content: `ComplexAnalytic.specMap_unique` is it plus
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData.hom_ext`, and both laws below are derived from
  that. **The claim is about the statements and not about a hypothetical definition ignoring `ψ`**,
  which is a counterfactual nobody on this line of work has exhibited a member of.
- `ComplexAnalytic.specMap_unique`: **and it is the only morphism that does.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.comm_specMapPart_id` and `ComplexAnalytic.comm_specMapPart_comp`: the
  compatibility hypothesis, discharged for the identity data and for a composite.
- `ComplexAnalytic.specMap_id` and `ComplexAnalytic.specMap_comp`: **the two functor laws.**

## What is not here

* **No functor.** As in `Oka/Analytification/CoverFunctoriality.lean`: there is no category of
  covered schemes in this repository to be a functor out of, since two covers of the same scheme
  are different inputs with no morphism between them until cover independence exists. The two
  laws below are the content a functor instance would carry.
* **No non-identity instance.** Nothing below exhibits a `σ` and a `ψ` other than the identity.
  `OkaTest/ProjectiveLine.lean` and `OkaTest/AffineCover.lean` are the two covers this repository
  has and neither has a map to the other, so the identity law is the only control here — the same
  gap the analytic file records, and for the same reason.
* **No square against the comparison morphism.** That
  `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationToSpecGlued` intertwines `ComplexAnalytic.coverMap` with
  `ComplexAnalytic.specMap` is `Oka/Analytification/ComparisonSquare.lean`, which imports this
  file and both of the others. It is not here because it needs the analytic morphism as well, and
  nothing in this file mentions an analytic space — **and keeping the two apart is what makes
  `ComplexAnalytic.specMap` cheap to consume**. Measured from `env.header.moduleNames` under
  `lake env lean`: this file costs `5137` modules, `84` of them `Oka`'s and `3303` `Mathlib`'s,
  which is `Oka/Analytification/SpecAffineCover.lean` plus itself and no `Mathlib` module at all.
  The square costs `5140 / 87 / 3303`. A reader who wants `X ⟶ Y` and not the comparison would
  pay those three extra modules if the two lived together, and one of them is the whole analytic
  comparison.
* **Nothing about `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme`.** `ComplexAnalytic.specFunctor` lands in
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace` and so does everything below;
  `Oka/Analytification/SpecAffineCover.lean` argues that absence is a result rather than an
  omission and this file does not weaken it.

/-! ### The compatibility condition -/

/-- **A family of morphisms out of the members which agrees over the chosen overlaps satisfies the
glue datum's compatibility condition.**

`CategoryTheory.GlueData.ofGlueData'_comm` at `ComplexAnalytic.specGlueData'`, and the mirror of
`ComplexAnalytic.comm_coverGlueData`. The hypothesis is at `i ≠ j` and the conclusion at every
pair: `ComplexAnalytic.specGlueData`'s diagonal is `CategoryTheory.GlueData.ofGlueData'`'s
`eqToHom`s and not `ComplexAnalytic.specTransition i i`, so there is nothing there for a caller to
check.

Do not try to derive this from `CategoryTheory.GlueData.glue_condition` by hand.
`Oka/CategoryTheory/GlueData.lean`'s module docstring is about why that fails, and
`ComplexAnalytic.specIncl_comp_specIota` — which reads it back the other way — was written after
four such derivations across two sessions had run into it. -/

needs neither. -/

**This is the statement about `ComplexAnalytic.specMap` with independent content**, and the claim
is meant no wider than it says: `ComplexAnalytic.specMap_unique` is this lemma plus
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData.hom_ext`, and both laws below are that, so a reader
who wants to know that `ComplexAnalytic.specMap` is built out of `ψ` at all need read only this
one. `ComplexAnalytic.comm_specMapPart_id` is *not* covered by that claim — it is about
`ComplexAnalytic.specMapPart` at the identity data and never mentions

/-- **The compatibility hypothesis, discharged for the composite data** — `τ ∘ σ` and
`fun i ↦ ψ i ≫ χ (σ i)`. So the composition law below asks a caller for nothing beyond the two
hypotheses its two morphisms already carry.

**The whole of it is that the composite's `i`-th part is the first map's `i`-th part followed by
the second morphism**, at every `i` and with no hypothesis at all:
`ComplexAnalytic.specMapPart` at the composite data is `specFunctor.map (ψ i ≫ χ (σ i))` followed
by the inclusion of the `τ (σ i)`-th member, the functor law splits the first factor, and
`ComplexAnalytic.specIota_comp_specMap` — which is `@[simp]` — folds the tail back into
`ComplexAnalytic.specMap`. Given that, the statement is `hcomm` postcomposed with one morphism,
which is what `reassoc_of%` does to it.

**The obstruction one expects here is not there, and it is worth naming which one.** `hcomm'` is
an equation at pairs `i ≠ j` of `K`, so a derivation that fed it the pair `(σ i, σ j)` would say
nothing whenever `σ i = σ j` — and nothing in the input forbids a cover map carrying two distinct
members of `X` into the same member of `Y`. **No such pair is ever formed.** `hcomm'` enters only
through `ComplexAnalytic.specMap`, which holds it whole, so nothing here splits on whether `σ` is
injective. The analytic mirror `ComplexAnalytic.comm_coverMapPart_comp` says the same, and the
first delivery of that file argued the opposite before it was measured. -/
