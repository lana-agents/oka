# The analytification of a standard étale morphism is finite étale over an open subset of the base

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale` is two fields and nothing else, and at an empty base
presentation this repository has had both for two files without ever putting them together:

* `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp`
  (`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleFiniteness.lean`) is the finiteness, **of the morphism
  restricted over `V`**;
* `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp`
  (`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleLocalIso.lean`) is the local isomorphism, **of the
  unrestricted morphism**.

The two are stated about different morphisms, and that is not an oversight in either file:
unrestricted finiteness is **false**, and
`Oka/Analytification/MonicHypersurface.lean` carries the counterexample in terms — compiled since
2026-09-02 as `ComplexAnalytic.not_isFinite_condEtaleProj`
(`OkaTest/StandardEtaleNotFinite.lean`), which is what makes *"stated about different morphisms"*
a measurement rather than a reading. So the class can only be
claimed for the restricted morphism, and what was missing was the second field *at the
restriction* — which is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_restrictHom`
(`Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenSubspace.lean`), a general fact about open subspaces with nothing étale in
it. Both files record the absence of that transport, in terms, and this file is what retires it.

## The asymmetry is the content, and a reader of the theorem alone cannot see it

The two fields are bought by two different hypotheses, and neither buys the other:

* **`IsFinite` needs `V`**, and needs only that `F` is monic. It is false without the restriction
  and it reads nothing about `G` beyond the bad set.
  `Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleFiniteness.lean` is explicit that it holds for *every*
  monic `F` and *every* `G`.
* **`IsLocalIso` needs the pair to be étale**, through
  `Mathlib.RingTheory.Etale.StandardEtale`'s `StandardEtalePair` and its `cond` field, and needs
  no restriction at all — it is true of the unrestricted morphism, and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_restrictHom` carries it down to `V` for free.

So this theorem's hypotheses are the *union* of the two halves' and its conclusion is about the
restricted morphism only. **Neither hypothesis is removable**: dropping `V` makes the first field
false, and dropping the `StandardEtalePair` leaves a morphism this development says nothing about
on stalks.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.isFiniteEtale_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp`: **the
  analytification of a standard étale morphism over affine space, restricted over an open subset
  of the base avoiding the bad set, is finite étale.** This is the whole of taxis #1112's §1 at an
  empty base presentation.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isFiniteEtale_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp_compl`: the same
  at the largest such open subset, the complement of
  `ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfaceCommonZeroImage`, which is open by
  `ComplexAnalytic.isClosed_hypersurfaceCommonZeroImage`.

## Placement, and it was priced against appending to the finiteness file

`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleFiniteness.lean` is where the issue that asked for this expected
it, and the cost was measured both ways with `lake env lean` on the environment's own
`getEnv.header.moduleNames`, counting modules under `Oka/` and `Mathlib/` — the convention
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenSubspace.lean` states and `scripts/import_cost.py` documents:

* appending there and adding the `Oka.Analytification.StandardEtaleLocalIso` edge takes that
  file's closure from **3473 to 3480**, and the seven are named:
  `Oka.Analytification.StandardEtaleLocalIso`, `Oka.AnalyticSpace.SimpleZeroTopology`,
  `Oka.AnalyticSpace.SimpleZeroPolynomial`, `Oka.GermDerivative`, `Oka.Analysis.Calculus.Implicit`,
  `Mathlib.Analysis.Calculus.Implicit`, `Mathlib.Analysis.Normed.Module.Complemented`;
* this file's own closure is **3481**, which is the same seven plus itself.

Each figure counts the module **and** its transitive imports, so the edge is `+7` either way.
They are **environment** counts and the distinction is not pedantry: a text-based walk over the
header lines, even one using `scripts/import_cost.py`'s comment-stripped extractor, comes out
about twenty low on a closure this size while reproducing the delta and the named set exactly.
Quote the delta from either instrument; quote an absolute only from the environment.

**So cost decides nothing** — both are leaves, imported by `Oka.lean` alone and by no module under
`OkaTest/`, so neither shape adds a build to the library and the seven modules are already built
for `Oka.lean` in either case.

**What decided it is a sentence in the other file that this theorem would falsify.**
`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleFiniteness.lean`'s `## What is not here` says *"No
`StandardEtalePair`, and no `StandardEtalePair.cond` is read. The theorems below hold for **every**
monic `F` and **every** `G`"*. That is a stance and not merely an absence: it says what that file's
theorems cost, and it is the reason its finiteness is reusable at pairs that are not étale. This
theorem reads a `StandardEtalePair`, so appending it there would have turned that paragraph into
*"every theorem below except one"*. A separate module keeps the weaker statement's file weak.

## What is not here

* **No `IsFiniteEtale` of the unrestricted morphism**, and there never will be: it is **false**,
  `Oka/Analytification/MonicHypersurface.lean` carries the witness and
  `ComplexAnalytic.not_isFiniteEtale_condEtaleProj` (`OkaTest/StandardEtaleNotFinite.lean`)
  compiles it, and nothing in this file narrows that. The restriction is in the statement because
  the first field needs it.
* **Nothing at `k ≥ 1`.** Both halves are at an empty base presentation, for the reasons their own
  files give, and a presented base is a different theorem rather than a missing hypothesis. **The
  local-isomorphism half of that different theorem now exists** —
  `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_analytificationMap_etalePresHom`
  (`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleLocalIsoBase.lean`), at every `k`, and about the structure
  map to `X^an` rather than the projection to `ℂ^n`. The finiteness half at `k ≥ 1` is untouched,
  so this bullet stands for the class as a whole.
* **Nothing about how large `V` is *here*, and the class is now instantiated elsewhere at a `V`
  that is proper and nonempty.** This bullet said no pair `(F, G)` was exhibited anywhere for
  which `V` is proper *and* nonempty; one is —
  `ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfaceCommonZeroImage_parabola`
  (`Oka/Analytification/OpenBaseFiniteness.lean`), instantiated for the finiteness half as
  `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp_parabola`.

  **It then said the parabola is *not* instantiated for this class, *"because the second field
  needs a `StandardEtalePair` and nothing exhibits the parabola as one"*, and that reason was
  false when it was written.** `ComplexAnalytic.condPair` (`OkaTest/StandardEtaleCond.lean`) *is*
  the parabola, at `n = 1` and `i = 0`, in the multivariate vocabulary rather than the polynomial
  one; `ComplexAnalytic.condPair` predates this bullet by 1d 22h and the parabola by 1d 23h, and
  nobody read them against each other. **This bullet is 1h 14m older than the parabola**, so the
  two intervals are not the same one: the pair is `5ae9ed5`, this bullet was first written at
  `868ed5f`, and the parabola and the clause just quoted arrived together at `028808f`.
  `ComplexAnalytic.isFiniteEtale_restrictHom_condEtaleProj`
  (`OkaTest/CondFiniteEtale.lean`) is the theorem below at that pair, and the `V` it holds over is
  the punctured line — proper and nonempty, by
  `ComplexAnalytic.condGoodOpen_nonempty` and `ComplexAnalytic.condGoodOpen_ne_univ`. **The same
  morphism unrestricted is not finite étale**, which is
  `ComplexAnalytic.not_isFiniteEtale_condEtaleProj` (`OkaTest/StandardEtaleNotFinite.lean`), and
  neither is its restriction over `⊤`, which is
  `ComplexAnalytic.not_isFiniteEtale_restrictHom_condEtaleProj_top` in the same file as the
  positive half — so the two sides of the comparison are the restriction below at two opens, and
  the hypothesis on `V` is doing visible work at one compiled instance.

  **What stays true is the last clause and it is the one that matters here**: the size of `V`
  remains a hypothesis on the pair rather than a theorem, nothing below bounds it, and the
  instance is in the test library rather than in this one — a reader of the theorem below alone
  still cannot conclude that the morphism is finite étale over anything in particular.
* **No comparison functor and no Riemann existence theorem.** A *different and broader* absence —
  the analytification of a finite étale morphism of **schemes** — is what
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalIso.lean`, `Oka/AnalyticSpace/CoveringMap.lean` and
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SigmaFiniteEtale.lean` record, and nothing here touches it: everything on
  this line is one standard étale presentation over `ℂ^n`, and the general morphism is a
  Zariski-local gluing that nothing starts.
* **No `IsCoveringMap`.** `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoveringMap_base_of_isFiniteEtale`
  needs a Hausdorff source and it is not checked here.

/-- **The analytification of a standard étale morphism over `ℂ^n` is finite étale over an open
subset of the base avoiding the bad set.**

The two fields are the two halves and nothing is done between them: `isFinite` is
`ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp` verbatim, and
`isLocalIso` is `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp` carried across
the restriction by `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_restrictHom`.

**Which hypothesis buys which field is the whole content and is worth reading off the proof.**
`hF` and `hV` are the first field's and are not read by the second; `P`, `hFP` and `hGP` are the
second field's and are not read by the first. The restriction is asked for by the first field
alone — the second holds of the unrestricted morphism — and it is not removable, since
unrestricted finiteness is false.

**The morphism is passed to `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_restrictHom` explicitly, and
that is forced.** Written with a `_` there the declaration fails with *"(deterministic) timeout at
`isDefEq`"* at the default budget, measured: elaboration has to unify `restrictHom ?f V` against a
goal whose source is spelled through `Opens.map`, which is the same `Opens`-spelling seam
`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleFiniteness.lean` records twice and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_restrictHom` a third time. **It is the `_` that costs and
not the structure syntax** — with the morphism named, both the `where` form and an anonymous
constructor compile. -/

`ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp_compl` is the finiteness
half at this `V` and this is its finite-étale strengthening; monicity is what makes the complement
open, through `ComplexAnalytic.isClosed_hypersurfaceCommonZeroImage`.
