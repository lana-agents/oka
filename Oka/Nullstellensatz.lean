# The analytic Nullstellensatz: the vanishing ideal, and the easy inclusion

For an ideal `I` of the germ ring `LocalOkaRing ι`, write `V(I)` for the common zero locus of
`I` near the origin and `I(V(I))` for the ideal of germs vanishing on it. The **Rückert
Nullstellensatz** states

```
I(V(I)) = √I.
```

**Only the inclusion `√I ≤ I(V(I))` is proved in this file.** The reverse inclusion
`I(V(I)) ≤ √I` is where all the content lies, and it is **not** proved here or anywhere else in
this development: it needs the *local parametrisation theorem* — that after a change of
coordinates a germ of an analytic set is a branched cover of a polydisc, obtained by applying
Weierstrass preparation to the discriminant — and none of that machinery exists in this
repository. A reader should not take the presence of this file as evidence that the
Nullstellensatz is available.

The easy inclusion is elementary: if `f ^ n ∈ I` then `f` vanishes wherever every element of `I`
does, because `ℂ` has no nilpotents.

## Implementation notes

There is no notion of a germ of a *subset* of `ℂ^ι` here, and none is introduced. Instead only
the composite operator `I ↦ I(V(I))` is defined, directly, as `LocalOkaRing.vanishingIdeal`.
That is all the Nullstellensatz statement needs, it avoids a quotient construction, and it makes
the easy inclusion nearly immediate. If a later development needs germs of sets in their own
right — for the hard inclusion, say — this definition should be revisited rather than built on.

Membership is an eventuality in `𝓝 0`, not a condition on a fixed neighbourhood: a germ has no
canonical domain, so any formulation over a fixed neighbourhood would depend on a choice of
representative. For the same reason the evaluation of a germ is only a ring homomorphism
*eventually*, which is what `LocalOkaRing.eventually_eval_add`, `eventually_eval_mul` and
`eventually_eval_pow` record; they are what make `vanishingIdeal` an ideal.

## Main definitions

- `LocalOkaRing.VanishesOn I f`: near the origin, `f` vanishes wherever every element of `I`
  does.
- `LocalOkaRing.vanishingIdeal I`: the germs vanishing on the zero locus of `I`.

## Main results

- `LocalOkaRing.eq_zero_of_eventually_eval_eq_zero`: a germ whose evaluation vanishes near the
  origin is zero — the identity theorem, in the form used here.
- `LocalOkaRing.le_vanishingIdeal` and `LocalOkaRing.isRadical_vanishingIdeal`.
- `LocalOkaRing.radical_le_vanishingIdeal`: **the easy half of the Nullstellensatz**.
- `LocalOkaRing.vanishingIdeal_bot` and `LocalOkaRing.vanishingIdeal_top`: the two degenerate
  cases, computed. These are the check that the definition is not vacuous — `vanishingIdeal ⊥`
  is `⊥`, not `⊤`, and it is the identity theorem that makes it so.
