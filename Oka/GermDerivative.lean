# The linear coefficients of a germ are the partial derivatives at the point

`OkaRing.germ hy f` is the Taylor series of a holomorphic function `f` at a point `y` of its
domain (`Oka/Weierstrass.lean`). This file identifies its coefficient at `Finsupp.single j 1`
with the derivative of `f` at `y` in the `j`-th coordinate direction —
`fderiv ℂ (f.toGlobalFun U) y (Pi.single j 1)`.

**This is for an arbitrary holomorphic function**, and that is the point.
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimpleZeroPolynomial.lean` identifies the same coefficient with
`MvPolynomial.pderiv` when the germ comes from a polynomial, and `Oka/Regular.lean`'s
§*Why the hypothesis is stated with `PowerSeries.order` and not with a derivative* records that
what the tree has for a general germ is a *number at a point*. This is that number, produced from
`f` rather than from a polynomial presenting it.

## What the proof is

Three steps and no analysis of its own:

* `MvPowerSeries.LocallyConvergent.fderiv_eval_zero` (`Oka/Weierstrass.lean`) says the linear
  coefficients of a locally convergent series are the partial derivatives *of its sum, at the
  origin*, and every germ satisfies its hypothesis because `LocalOkaRing ι` is by definition the
  locally convergent series (`LocalOkaRing.locallyConvergent`);
* `OkaRing.germ_represents` says that sum is `z ↦ f (z + y)` near the origin, so the two have the
  same derivative there (`Filter.EventuallyEq.fderiv_eq`);
* `fderiv_comp_add_right` moves the derivative of `z ↦ f (z + y)` at `0` to the derivative of `f`
  at `y`.

## Main results

- `OkaRing.coeff_single_one_germ`: **the coefficient of `X j` in the Taylor series of `f` at `y`
  is `fderiv ℂ (f.toGlobalFun U) y (Pi.single j 1)`.**
- `OkaRing.toGlobalFun_eq_evalHom`: the extension by zero evaluated at a point of the domain is
  the evaluation homomorphism there, which is the spelling every consumer of the above needs,
  since the sheaf-theoretic statements evaluate a section rather than a global function.

## What is not here

* **No derivative of a germ as a germ.** The right-hand side is a complex number, not an element
  of `LocalOkaRing ι`; there is still no operator `∂/∂X j : LocalOkaRing ι → LocalOkaRing ι`, and
  so "`∂f/∂X j` is a unit at the point" is still not expressible. `Oka/Regular.lean` says so and
  is not falsified by this file.
* **No higher coefficients.** Only the coefficients at `Finsupp.single j 1`; nothing about
  `Finsupp.single j 2` or about mixed terms, which would be higher derivatives divided by
  factorials.
* **No statement quantified over `LocalOkaRing ι`.** The result below is about `OkaRing.germ` and
  quantifies over the holomorphic function `f`; whether every element of `LocalOkaRing ι` is such
  a germ is a surjectivity statement this file neither uses nor proves.
