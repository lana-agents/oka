# Fibre products of separated covers, and `HasFiniteLimits` over a Hausdorff base

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtale.lean` builds the category
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver` of covers separated over the base, gives
it a terminal object with no hypothesis whatever, and lists in its `## What is not here` the
absences that stand between it and a Galois category — the first being *"base change over a
general cospan of morphisms of this category"*. **This file closes that one**, over a Hausdorff
base, and assembles it with the terminal object into

    CategoryTheory.Limits.HasFiniteLimits
      (ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver X)   for `[T2Space X]`

## Which field this is, measured rather than repeated

**`HasFiniteLimits` is not a field of `PreGaloisCategory`, and saying so is the point of this
section**: the filing this module was written from called it one, and a reader who takes that on
trust will look for a field that does not exist. `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Galois/Basic.lean`
declares `PreGaloisCategory` with **five** fields and no `hasFiniteLimits` among them — the two
limit fields are separate — and the run that settles it is `Lean.getStructureInfo?` at that class,
which returns `hasTerminal`, `hasPullbacks`, `hasFiniteCoproducts`,
`hasQuotientsByFiniteGroups` and `monoInducesIsoOnDirectSummand`.

**So what this file closes is the `hasPullbacks` field**, and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.hasFiniteLimits` below is the standard
consequence of that field together with `hasTerminal`, which the category already had. **Two of
the five fields now hold for this category and three do not** — `hasFiniteCoproducts`,
`hasQuotientsByFiniteGroups` and `monoInducesIsoOnDirectSummand` — which the `## What is not here`
section below states rather than implies.

That namespace is not in this repository's import closure, so every name in the paragraph above is
prose and not a citation. **That is a measurement and not a convention**: no module reachable from
`Oka.lean` imports anything under `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Galois/`, on an import-graph walk of the
whole tree, and `scripts/check_docstring_names.py` reports the dotted form —
CategoryTheory.PreGaloisCategory, written without backticks here so that this sentence does not
fail the check it is describing — as resolving to nothing in the environment of `import Oka`. That
is why the bare form is used above, which is the spelling
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtale.lean` and `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Sigma.lean` already use for
the same reason.

## The construction costs no new mathematics, and that is a claim with a check behind it

**Every input is a landed declaration and none of them is edited.** The object is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChange` of `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleBaseChange.lean`, its
universal property is that file's `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChangeLift` with
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChangeLift_fst`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChangeLift_snd` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChange_hom_ext` around it, and the two conditions that make the
result an object of this category are the two `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtale.lean`
already discharges for
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.selfProd`, with the second leg of the
cospan put where that construction repeats the first. **That is literal and not a resemblance**:
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fibreProd_self` below says
`fibreProd i i = selfProd i`, and it is `rfl`, as are the two statements beside it about the
projections. So the earlier construction is this one at a repeated leg and no second idea entered
between them.

**What this file adds over the ambient fibre product is the comma category and nothing else.** The
underlying analytic space, the two projections and the lift are `baseChange`'s; what is proved
here is that each of them is a morphism *over* `X`, and that the object carries the pair an object
of this category is. The universal property is then
`CategoryTheory.Limits.PullbackCone.IsLimit.mk` at
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fibreProdLift` and four statements of this
file — the square, the two triangles and the extensionality — **each of which is one ambient lemma
read through `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.Over.Hom.ext` and nothing else**:
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChange_square`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChangeLift_fst`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChangeLift_snd` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChange_hom_ext` in that order. That extensionality is what
reduces equality of morphisms of this category to equality of their underlying morphisms.

## Where the Hausdorff hypothesis is spent, and where the asymmetry comes from

**The construction spends `[T2Space X]` through exactly two declarations of
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtale.lean`:**

* **`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.t2Space_left`**, which gives
  `[T2Space A.left]`. `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChange` asks that of the source of its
  finite étale leg and `Oka/AnalyticSpace/CoveringMap.lean` records why it is not removable there.
* **`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isFiniteEtale_left`**, which makes the
  underlying morphism of `i` finite étale. That statement spends the **target**'s separatedness
  and the target of `i` is `C`.

**Three more of that file's `[T2Space X]` declarations are named at the foot of this one** —
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.selfProd`, `…selfProdFst` and
`…selfProdSnd`, on the right-hand side of the three `rfl`s. They carry the hypothesis for the same
reason the construction does and add no use of it that the two bullets above do not already
account for, but *exactly two* would be false of the file as a whole and is not what is claimed.

**The construction is not symmetric in the two legs and the asymmetry is in the inputs, not in a
choice made here.** `i` is the leg that is base-changed: its underlying morphism has to be finite
étale, by `…isFiniteEtale_left i`, and separated, by
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isSeparatedMap_left i` — which reads
separatedness off `A`'s structure morphism and asks nothing of `C`. `j` is asked for nothing
beyond being a morphism of this category; what is used of `B` is its own structure morphism's
finite étaleness and separatedness, which the object carries. **The symmetric statement holds by
symmetry of the limit and not by rerunning this**, and no statement below says so.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fibreProd`: **the fibre product of two
  morphisms of this category, as an object of it** — `baseChange` of the underlying morphisms,
  structured over `X` by the second projection followed by `B`'s structure morphism.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fibreProdFst` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fibreProdSnd`: **its two projections**,
  as morphisms of this category.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fibreProdLift`: **the morphism a
  commuting square induces into it**, at a hypothesis stated on the underlying morphisms.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isPullback_fibreProd`: **the square is a
  pullback in this category**.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.hasPullback` and
  `…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.hasPullbacks`: **so every cospan of this category has a fibre
  product**, over a Hausdorff base.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.hasFiniteLimits`: **and the category has
  all finite limits**, which is the consequence of two fields and is itself none, as the head of
  this file measures.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fibreProd_self`, with
  `…fibreProdFst_self` and `…fibreProdSnd_self`: **the self-product this category already had is
  this construction at a repeated leg**, on the nose.

## What is not here

* **No `PreGaloisCategory` instance, and no claim that one is close.** That class is not in this
  repository's import closure — measured at the head of this file rather than assumed — so it
  cannot be cited by name in a statement here, and **three of
  its five fields are untouched**: `hasFiniteCoproducts`, `hasQuotientsByFiniteGroups` and
  `monoInducesIsoOnDirectSummand`. The last is the one this repository is nearest to —
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.inducesIsoOnDirectSummand_of_mono`
  answers it under `[T2Space X]`, which the field does not ask, and lands its summand in the
  covers rather than in this category. **What stands between that statement and the field is the
  existential that hides which object the summand is**, which
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtale.lean`'s own `## What is not here` states and this file
  does not restate, together with the `[T2Space X]` above.
* **Nothing here bears on a fibre functor**, which is a different class — `FiberFunctor` in the
  `PreGaloisCategory` namespace, with fields of its own — and not a field of the one above.
  **`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtale.lean`'s bullet lists the preservation of epimorphisms
  by a fibre functor among *the other fields* of `PreGaloisCategory`, and that is a slip**: it is a
  field of `FiberFunctor`. **This push does not repair it**, because the sentence carrying it is
  scoped to that file and stays true of it, and widening into a second module's
  `## What is not here` for one word is not what this push is. The measurement is recorded so a
  later seat does not have to make it again.
* **This is not `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.IsStableUnderBaseChange` for
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale`, and the bullets recording that absence are not
  narrowed.** That class quantifies over cospans in `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` whose finite
  étale leg may have a non-Hausdorff source, and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.doubledLineOver` is the standing witness that such a cospan
  exists. Every cospan below is a cospan of **objects of this category**, whose total spaces are
  Hausdorff by `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.t2Space_left`. The bullets
  in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleBaseChange.lean` and `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`
  say what they said before this file existed.
* **`[T2Space X]` is not removed and nothing here tries.** The construction spends it through the
  two declarations the section above names, and the first of those two spends it through a
  statement whose own hypothesis is Mathlib's in the criterion that turns a proper local
  homeomorphism into a covering map.
* **No finite coproducts and no `CategoryTheory.Limits.HasFiniteColimits`.**
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.isSeparatedMap_sigma` makes the objects
  available, as `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtale.lean` records; the cofan and the colimit
  are not built here and this file does not touch that line.
* **Nothing is said about the fibres or the degree of the fibre product.** The construction is the
  set-level pullback with an analytic structure and its fibres correspond, by
  `Function.Pullback.fst`; no statement below mentions
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_eq_card_fiber`.
* **No comparison with `CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback` in the ambient category.** The forgetful
  functor `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.toFiniteEtaleOver` and the
  functor to `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` are not shown to preserve these limits, although the
  underlying object is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChange` on the nose and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isPullback_baseChange` is the ambient square. **What is missing
  is the statement and not the mathematics**, and a push that wants it should say which of the two
  functors it means.

/-! ### The object and its two projections -/

/-- **The fibre product of two morphisms of this category, as an object of it.**

The underlying analytic space is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChange` of the two underlying
morphisms, written out rather than transported, so that the projections below can be stated with
no `eqToHom`; it is structured over `X` by the second projection followed by `B`'s structure
morphism. **The two components of the object's pair are
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.selfProd`'s with `j.left` in the slot that
construction repeats `i.left` in**, and the file's header says so with a `rfl`.

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChange` asks `[IsFiniteEtale i.left]` and `[T2Space A.left]`;
the first is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isFiniteEtale_left`, which spends the
separatedness of the **target** `C`, and the second is the instance
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.t2Space_left`, which is where `[T2Space X]`
enters. **Separatedness of the structure morphism is two steps**: `IsSeparatedMap.pullback` makes
the projection to `B.left` separated because
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isSeparatedMap_left` makes `i` separated,
and `IsSeparatedMap.comp` composes that with `B`'s own structure morphism. **Nothing is asked of
`j` beyond its being a morphism of this category**, which is the asymmetry the header describes. -/
def fibreProd (i : A ⟶ C) (j : B ⟶ C) : SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.{u} X :=
  haveI : IsFiniteEtale i.left := isFiniteEtale_left i
  haveI : IsFiniteEtale (X := B.left) B.hom := B.prop.1
  haveI : IsFiniteEtale (baseChangeSnd i.left j.left) := isFiniteEtale_baseChangeSnd i.left j.left

      ((isSeparatedMap_left i).pullback _).comp B.isSeparatedMap_hom
        (baseChangeSnd i.left j.left).toLRSHom.base.hom.continuous⟩

/-- **Its second projection, as a morphism of this category.** Its triangle over `X` is `rfl`,
because that projection is what the object was structured by. -/
def fibreProdSnd (i : A ⟶ C) (j : B ⟶ C) : fibreProd i j ⟶ B :=
  haveI : IsFiniteEtale i.left := isFiniteEtale_left i
  MorphismProperty.Over.homMk (baseChangeSnd i.left j.left) rfl

/-- **Its first projection, as a morphism of this category.**

The triangle over `X` is where `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChange_square` is spent: `A.hom`
is `i.left ≫ C.hom` and `B.hom` is `j.left ≫ C.hom`, both because a morphism of this category
commutes with the structure maps, and the two composites into `C.left` agree by that square.
**The `change` is not a `show` and the two `rfl`s at the ends of `e1` and `e2` are the comma
category's seam**, for the reason
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.selfProdFst`'s docstring gives of the same
two lines: `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.Over` is a comma category over
`CategoryTheory.Functor.id`, so a structure morphism's source is `(𝟭 _).obj A.left` rather than
`A.left`, and a `rw` whose motive crosses that unifier fails on an instance argument rather than
on the equation. -/

    rw [e1, e2, baseChange_square])

/-- **The square commutes in this category.**
`CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.Over.Hom.ext` at
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChange_square`, which is the whole of it: the comma category
contributes the extensionality and nothing else, and the triangles over `X` are already carried by
the two projections. -/

    fibreProdFst i j ≫ i = fibreProdSnd i j ≫ j :=

/-! ### The universal property -/

/-- **The morphism a commuting square induces into the fibre product.**

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChangeLift` at the underlying morphisms, made a morphism over
`X` by `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChangeLift_snd`: the composite to the structure morphism
of the fibre product is the lift followed by the second projection followed by `B.hom`, which is
`b.left ≫ B.hom` and so is `Z.hom`.

**The hypothesis is stated on the underlying morphisms and not as `a ≫ i = b ≫ j`**, which is the
form a caller holding a `CategoryTheory.Limits.PullbackCone` has to convert to anyway — the
conversion is `congrArg` at `left` and is `rfl`-thin because
`CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.Comma.comp_left` is `rfl`. Stating it this way keeps the `rfl`
at the one call site in this file rather than inside the definition, where a later reader would
have to unfold it to see what was proved. -/
def fibreProdLift (i : A ⟶ C) (j : B ⟶ C) {Z : SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.{u} X}

/-- **And over `B`.** `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChangeLift_snd` read the same way — the

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fibreProdLift` is proved from, and spent
here at its own statement rather than under a composite. -/

of a `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.Over` is an equality of underlying morphisms, so no
cancellation in this category is needed and the ambient statement transfers with no side
condition. -/

second idea entered**, stated as a theorem so that it cannot go stale silently: if either
construction is rewritten, this line stops compiling. -/
