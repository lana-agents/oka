# The fibre functor at the separated covers, and the two axioms of it that are reachable

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean` builds the fibre at a point of the base as a functor out
of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver X`, into `Type u` and into `FintypeCat`, and
proves of it everything this repository knows about a fibre functor: that it preserves the terminal
object, that it is faithful, and that it is conservative. **All of that is stated one category out
from where the Galois-category axioms are being assembled.**

`Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Galois/Basic.lean` — whose namespace is not in this repository's import
closure and so cannot be cited by name here — asks for two things at once: a `PreGaloisCategory`
structure on a category, and a `FiberFunctor` structure on a functor out of **that same category**
into `FintypeCat`. The first of those is being built at
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver X`, where
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.hasTerminal` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.inducesIsoOnDirectSummand_of_mono'` already
are. **This file is the fibre functor at that category**, and the two of its six obligations that
are reachable with what is in the tree.

## The `[T2Space]` that stops being a hypothesis, which is the one thing here that is not transport

At the covers, faithfulness and conservativity of the fibre functor hold on the full subcategory
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.isPreconnectedT2`, whose objects satisfy **two**
conditions on their total space — preconnected *and* Hausdorff. Over a Hausdorff base the second is
free here: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.t2Space_left` is an instance, so
every `[T2Space (B.left)]` an ambient lemma asks for is discharged by the object that carries it.

**So the subcategory this file cuts,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isPreconnected`, is one condition and not
two**, and that is the form that matters for a Galois category: the conservativity axiom is about
the category the other axioms are stated over, so every condition that has to be cut away from it
is a gap between what is proved and what the axiom asks. This file closes one of the two and
leaves the other.

**Where the hypothesis is spent instead** is the variable block: `[T2Space (X : Type u)]` on the
base, which is what `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.t2Space_left` consumes.
The terminal-object statements below are outside that block and ask for nothing at all.

## What is transported, and how

The two functors are composites with
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.toFiniteEtaleOver`, which is full and
faithful, and every statement below is that functor's ambient counterpart read across it:

* **faithfulness** is `CategoryTheory.Functor.map_injective` of the inclusion composed with the
  ambient injectivity — the inclusion contributes the outer injection and the ambient lemma the
  inner one;
* **conservativity** is `CategoryTheory.isIso_of_reflects_iso` twice, once along the inclusion and
  once along the subcategory's;
* **the terminal object** is *not* transported, and could not be: a fully faithful functor does not
  carry terminal objects without an argument about its essential image.
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isTerminalId` is the cone, proved in its
  own category for that reason, and what the inclusion contributes is one `rfl` —
  `(…toFiniteEtaleOver X).obj (…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.id X)` **is**
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.id X`, so the ambient fibre computation applies to
  it unchanged.

**The instance arguments are passed positionally and that is deliberate.**
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`'s `faithful_fiberFunctor` docstring records the seam: the
comma category's `A.left` and `((…toFiniteEtaleOver X).obj A).left` are the same by `rfl` and not
reducibly so, so instance search does not cross between them and a `haveI` does not repair it.
Every `@`-application below is that, and none of them is a mathematical step.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fiberFunctor` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fintypeFiberFunctor`: **the fibre at a
  point of the base, as a functor out of the separated covers**, into `Type u` and into
  `FintypeCat`; the second is the shape a Galois category asks for.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.preservesTerminal_fiberFunctor` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.preservesTerminal_fintypeFiberFunctor`:
  **both preserve the terminal object**, with no hypothesis on the base and none on the point.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isPreconnected`: **the separated covers
  whose total space is preconnected**, as a full subcategory, with its terminal object
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.hasTerminalSubcategory` and the
  preservation
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.preservesTerminal_ι`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fiberFunctor_map_injective` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fintypeFiberFunctor_map_injective`:
  **both are injective on morphisms out of a preconnected object**, with nothing asked of the
  target.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.faithful_fiberFunctor` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.faithful_fintypeFiberFunctor`: **both are
  faithful on that subcategory.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isIso_of_bijective_fiberMap`: **a
  morphism whose fibre map at one point is bijective is an isomorphism**, over a preconnected
  target.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.reflectsIsomorphisms_fiberFunctor` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.reflectsIsomorphisms_fintypeFiberFunctor`:
  **both are conservative on that subcategory** — the sixth Galois-category obligation on a fibre
  functor.

## What is not here

* **No `FiberFunctor` instance, and no `PreGaloisCategory` instance to hang one on.** It is
  `FiberFunctor` that has **six** fields — preservation of terminal objects, of pullbacks, of
  finite coproducts, of epimorphisms and of quotients by finite group actions, and reflection of
  isomorphisms — and this file supplies the **first and the last** and says nothing about the other
  four. It is not a partial instance and no `PreGaloisCategory` instance is declared anywhere in
  this repository; at the commit that adds this file, `PreGaloisCategory` occurs in the
  comment-stripped code of no module of it at all.
* **Not the preservation of pullbacks, and the obstruction is not a missing instance.**
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtaleLimits.lean` gives the fibre product of separated covers
  over a Hausdorff base, so the limit whose image would have to be computed exists; what is missing
  is an identification of the **fibre** of that limit with the set-theoretic pullback of the two
  fibres. **Measured rather than asserted**: `Function.Pullback`, which is how this repository
  spells such an identification, occurs in the comment-stripped code of **four** modules at the
  commit that adds this file — `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleBaseChange.lean`,
  `Oka/Topology/Covering/Basic.lean`, `OkaTest/Axioms/Morphisms.lean` and
  `OkaTest/CoveringBaseChange.lean` — the first two being the base change of a finite étale
  morphism over its own cospan and the topological statement it rests on. **None of the four is
  about `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fibreProd`**, and nothing carries
  the identification to it.
* **Not the preservation of finite coproducts, and what is absent is the statement and not the
  colimit.** Finite coproducts of this category are in the tree —
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.hasFiniteCoproducts`, with no hypothesis
  on the base — but they are in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtaleCoproducts.lean`, **a
  sibling of this module which neither imports it nor is imported by it, both importing
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtale.lean`**, so that instance is not in scope below and
  nothing here could consume it without a new import. The ambient preservation statement
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.preservesFiniteCoproducts_fintypeFiberFunctor` is
  in this module's closure; what is not here is either that read across the inclusion or an
  identification of the fibre of a disjoint union of separated covers with the disjoint union of
  the fibres. **Measured rather than asserted**: `preservesFiniteCoproducts` occurs in the
  comment-stripped code of exactly **two** modules at the commit that adds this file —
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`, which declares it, and `OkaTest/Axioms/Morphisms.lean`,
  which guards it — and neither is about a functor out of
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver`.
* **Not the preservation of epimorphisms and not quotients by finite group actions**, and the two
  absences are not the same shape. `CategoryTheory.SingleObj`, which is the shape the quotients
  field is stated over, occurs in the comment-stripped code of **no** module of this repository at
  the commit that adds this file. `CategoryTheory.Functor.PreservesEpimorphisms` occurs in **two**
  — `Oka/Algebra/Category/Grp/EpiMono.lean` and
  `Oka/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/Colimits.lean` — and **neither is about a cover or about a
  fibre functor**, so what is absent is the statement at these functors and not the class.
* **Nothing at `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver` is superseded or restated.**
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.isPreconnectedT2` and every statement over it are
  unchanged and stay the right ones for a caller working in the covers, which is the reason
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedDirectSummand.lean` gives for the same asymmetry at the direct
  summand.
* **The subcategory's preconnectedness condition is not removed and this file does not argue that
  it could be.** It is the hypothesis
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.isIso_of_bijective_fiberMap` asks of its target
  and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.fiberFunctor_map_injective` asks of its
  source; what this file removes is the **Hausdorff** half of the ambient subcategory's condition
  and nothing else.

/-! ### The two fibre functors -/

/-- **The fibre at a point of the base, as a functor out of the separated covers.**

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.fiberFunctor` composed with the inclusion
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.toFiniteEtaleOver`, which is all it is: an
object of this category is an object of the covers carrying one extra proof, and the fibre does not
see the proof.

**It is stated as a composite rather than restated with its own `obj` and `map` fields**, so that
`CategoryTheory.Functor.comp` is what the two functor laws come from and no `rfl` is re-proved
here. The cost is that every statement below has to unfold one composite to reach the ambient
lemma, and the benefit is that `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.fiberMap` is
literally the map. -/
def SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fiberFunctor (x : X) :
    SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.{u} X ⥤ Type u :=
  SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.toFiniteEtaleOver X ⋙ FiniteEtaleOver.fiberFunctor.{u} x

/-- **The same into `FintypeCat`**, which is the shape a Galois category asks for.

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.fintypeFiberFunctor` composed with the same
inclusion. **This is the functor a `FiberFunctor` structure would be asked of**, that structure
living in `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Galois/Basic.lean`, whose namespace is not in this repository's
import closure and so cannot be cited by name here.

**No import is added for it**: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.fintypeFiberFunctor`
already pays for `Mathlib.CategoryTheory.FintypeCat` and this file imports
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtale.lean`, which is downstream of it. -/
def SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fintypeFiberFunctor (x : X) :
    SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.{u} X ⥤ FintypeCat.{u} :=
  SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.toFiniteEtaleOver X ⋙ FiniteEtaleOver.fintypeFiberFunctor.{u} x

/-! ### Both preserve the terminal object -/

/-- **The value of the `FintypeCat`-valued fibre functor at the base over itself is terminal.**

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.isTerminalFintypeFiberId` **applies to this
statement unchanged**, and the reason is one `rfl`:
`(…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.toFiniteEtaleOver X).obj (…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.id X)` is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.id X` on the nose, both being
`CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.Over.mk` at the identity with a proof, and the proofs are
propositions. So the two sides of this `def` are the same type and the ambient declaration is the
term.

**Nothing about the terminal object of this category is transported along the inclusion.** That is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isTerminalId`, proved in its own category
for the reason its docstring gives — a terminal object does not cross a fully faithful functor
without an argument about the essential image — and what is shared is only the *fibre* of the one
object the two categories name the same way. -/
def SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isTerminalFintypeFiberId (x : X) :
    Limits.IsTerminal ((SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fintypeFiberFunctor.{u} x).obj
      (SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.id.{u} X)) :=
  FiniteEtaleOver.isTerminalFintypeFiberId.{u} x

/-- **The `Type u`-valued fibre functor preserves the terminal object**, with no hypothesis on the
base and none on the point.

`CategoryTheory.Limits.preservesLimit_of_preserves_limit_cone` at
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isTerminalId`, with
`CategoryTheory.Limits.isLimitMapConeEmptyConeEquiv` turning *the image cone is a limit* into *the
image object is terminal* and `CategoryTheory.Limits.Types.isTerminalEquivUnique` reading the
latter off `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.uniqueFiberId`, the fibre of the base
over itself being a point.

**This is the `preservesTerminalObjects` field of a `FiberFunctor` structure, at this category.**
It is one field of six and this instance supplies none of the other five; the module docstring's
`## What is not here` says which they are and why each is out of reach.

**The conclusion is `CategoryTheory.Limits.PreservesLimitsOfShape` at the empty shape and not
`CategoryTheory.Limits.PreservesLimit` at `CategoryTheory.Functor.empty`**, for the reason
`…FiniteEtaleOver.preservesLimitsOfShape_pempty_fiberFunctor`'s
docstring gives at length: the converter between them is a `lemma` in one direction and an instance
in the other, so the stronger spelling costs a line here and saves it at every use.

**The name says `preservesTerminal` where the ambient one says `preservesLimitsOfShape_pempty`, and
the reason is arithmetic and not taste.** `OkaTest/Axioms/Morphisms.lean` guards every declaration
of this module with a `#print axioms` command, and that command's name has to fit a line: this
namespace is nine characters longer than
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver`, and
`preservesLimitsOfShape_pempty_fintypeFiberFunctor` under it does not fit even wrapped onto its own
indented line. **The three instances of this shape are named for what they preserve instead**, which
is `CategoryTheory.Limits.preservesLimitsOfShape_pempty_of_preservesTerminal`'s own word for it, and
the statements are unchanged and are the ambient spelling. -/

The same proof with

inline conversion, for the reason that declaration's docstring gives about the bundling, and in the
same `CategoryTheory.Limits.PreservesLimitsOfShape` spelling. **Neither of the two is derived from
the other**: the two functors have the same underlying map and different bundlings of it, so
`CategoryTheory.Limits.IsTerminal` of one value is not `CategoryTheory.Limits.IsTerminal` of the

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.fintypeFiberFunctor_map_injective`'s docstring draws

/-! ### The preconnected subcategory, which is one condition and not two -/

variable (X) in
/-- **The separated covers whose total space is preconnected**, as an
`CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty` and hence as a full subcategory.

**One condition, where the ambient subcategory
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.isPreconnectedT2` has two.** The Hausdorff half of
that conjunction is carried by every object of this category over a Hausdorff base —
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.t2Space_left` is an instance — so cutting
it out here would be cutting out nothing. The module docstring's section *The `[T2Space]` that
stops being a hypothesis* is what this is about and says why the difference is not cosmetic.

**The condition is on the total space of the object and not on the base**, exactly as the ambient
one is; the base's own preconnectedness is a separate hypothesis and appears in the variable block
of the statements that need it. -/
def SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isPreconnected : ObjectProperty (SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.{u} X) :=
  fun A ↦ PreconnectedSpace (A.left : Type u)

/-- **The base over itself is an object of that subcategory**, when the base is preconnected.

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.id`'s total space is the base on the nose,
so this is one `inferInstanceAs` and no proof. **It asks no `[T2Space]`**, which
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.isPreconnectedT2_id` does, and the difference is the
subcategory's condition and not a different argument. -/
theorem SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isPreconnected_id (X : AnalyticSpace.{u})
    [PreconnectedSpace (X : Type u)] :
    SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isPreconnected.{u} X (SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.id.{u} X) :=
  inferInstanceAs (PreconnectedSpace (X : Type u))

/-- **The base over itself is terminal in that subcategory too**, when the base is preconnected.

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isTerminalId` read in the full subcategory:
the unique morphism into it is the ambient one, which lies in the subcategory because the
subcategory is full, and uniqueness is `CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty.hom_ext`.

**`CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty.homMk` and `CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty.hom_ext` are the two
functions that cross the seam**, and going through them keeps this computable, for the reason
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.isTerminalIdSubcategory`'s docstring gives: the
other route is `CategoryTheory.Functor.preimage` at `CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty.ι`, which is
data extracted from a `CategoryTheory.Functor.Full` instance. -/

**A subcategory inclusion does not preserve limits in general** — a full subcategory closed under
nothing need not contain the ambient limit — and what makes it do so here is that the ambient
terminal object lies in the subcategory, which is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isPreconnected_id`. **This is where
`[PreconnectedSpace X]` enters**, and it is the only hypothesis this statement has; the ambient
counterpart `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.preservesLimitsOfShape_pempty_ι` also
asks `[T2Space X]`, and that is the difference the module docstring is about.

/-- **The `Type u`-valued fibre functor is injective on morphisms out of a preconnected object**,
over a preconnected Hausdorff base, **with nothing asked of the target**.

Two injections composed. `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.toFiniteEtaleOver`
is faithful, so `CategoryTheory.Functor.map_injective` is the outer one; the inner one is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.fiberFunctor_map_injective` at the images of the two
objects.

**The target's `[T2Space]` is supplied and not assumed**, which is the whole point of stating this
here: that lemma asks `[T2Space (B.left)]`, and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.t2Space_left` is what hands it over. It is
**passed positionally**, for the seam
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.faithful_fiberFunctor`'s docstring records: `B.left`
and `((…toFiniteEtaleOver X).obj B).left` are the same by `rfl` and not reducibly so, so instance

variable [PreconnectedSpace (X : Type u)]

/-- **A morphism of separated covers whose fibre map at one point is bijective is an
isomorphism**, over a preconnected Hausdorff base and a preconnected target.

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.isIso_of_bijective_fiberMap` at the image of the
morphism, then `CategoryTheory.isIso_of_reflects_iso` along
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.toFiniteEtaleOver`, which reflects
isomorphisms because it is fully faithful.

**Both of the ambient lemma's `[T2Space]` hypotheses are supplied here**, on the source *and* on
the target, by `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.t2Space_left`; what is left
to the caller is the target's preconnectedness, which is exactly the subcategory's condition below.
Both are passed positionally, for the seam recorded on
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fiberFunctor_map_injective`. -/

/-- **The `Type u`-valued fibre functor is conservative on the preconnected subcategory**, over a
preconnected Hausdorff base.

`CategoryTheory.isIso_iff_bijective` reads the hypothesis as bijectivity of the fibre map,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isIso_of_bijective_fiberMap` turns that into
an isomorphism of the ambient category, and `CategoryTheory.isIso_of_reflects_iso` along the
subcategory inclusion puts it back. The target's preconnectedness is `B.property` and is passed
positionally, for the seam recorded above.

**Conservativity is one of the six Galois-category obligations on a fibre functor**, and it is one
of the two this file supplies; the module docstring's `## What is not here` says which four it does
not. -/

/-- **The same for the `FintypeCat`-valued fibre functor**, which is the one a Galois category asks
for.

**Not derived from the instance above and not a restatement of it**, for the reason
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.reflectsIsomorphisms_fintypeFiberFunctor`'s docstring
gives about its own pair: the two functors have the same `map` up to the bundling their targets ask
for, so `CategoryTheory.IsIso` of one is not `CategoryTheory.IsIso` of the other, and the
bijectivity has to be read off through the concrete-category forgetful functor,
`CategoryTheory.ConcreteCategory.isIso_iff_bijective`, rather than through
`CategoryTheory.isIso_iff_bijective`. -/
