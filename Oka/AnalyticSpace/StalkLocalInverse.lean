# The germ dictionary: a local inverse makes a holomorphic map an isomorphism on stalks

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/HolomorphicMap.lean` turns a family `u : κ → OkaRing ⊤` of entire functions
on `ℂ^ι` into a morphism of locally ringed spaces `ComplexAnalytic.okaMapHom u : ℂ^ι ⟶ ℂ^κ`
whose pullback of sections is **composition with `ComplexAnalytic.okaMapFun u`**. This file reads
that off at a stalk: the map `𝒪_{ℂ^κ, F z} ⟶ 𝒪_{ℂ^ι, z}` is precomposition of germs with
`F = okaMapFun u`, and precomposition with a map that has an analytic local inverse near `z` is
bijective.

**No analysis is done here.** The local inverse is a *hypothesis*: a function `σ` analytic at
`F z`, inverse to `F` on a neighbourhood on each side. Everything below is the translation
between that hypothesis and the stalk map, which is what nothing in this repository had.
Mathlib's `AnalyticAt.analyticAt_localInverse` and `analyticAt_comp_iff_of_deriv_ne_zero`
(`Mathlib/Analysis/Calculus/InverseFunctionTheorem/Analytic.lean`) are what produce such a `σ` in
one variable, and `OkaTest/FiniteMorphism.lean` uses them for `z ↦ z²` on `ℂ ∖ {0}`.

## Why the two halves are not symmetric

**Injectivity uses only the right inverse.** A germ killed by precomposition is a section
vanishing on `F ⁻¹' W'` for some `W'`; to see that the section itself vanishes near `F z` one
writes a point `w` near `F z` as `F (σ w)` and evaluates. Analyticity of `σ` is not used, only
its continuity, so this half holds for a topological local section.

**Surjectivity uses only the left inverse, and there analyticity is the whole point.** The
preimage of a germ `t` at `z` is `t ∘ σ`, which is a *holomorphic* function near `F z` exactly
because `σ` is analytic — `OkaAnalytic.comp_analyticOn` is the statement that
composing a holomorphic function with an analytic map is holomorphic, and it is the only place
in the file where the sheaf being a sheaf of *holomorphic* functions is used.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.injective_stalkMap_okaMapHom`
- `ComplexAnalytic.surjective_stalkMap_okaMapHom`
- `ComplexAnalytic.isIso_stalkMap_okaMapHom`: **a holomorphic map with an analytic local inverse
  at a point is an isomorphism on the stalk there.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isIso_stalkMap_okaMap`: the same for the morphism of complex
  analytic spaces.

/-- **Precomposition with a map admitting a continuous right inverse is injective on germs.**

If a germ at `okaMapFun u z` pulls back to zero then the pulling-back function vanishes on a
neighbourhood `V` of `z`; and every `w` near `okaMapFun u z` is `okaMapFun u (σ w)` with `σ w`
in `V`, so the germ itself is the germ of a function vanishing near `okaMapFun u z`.

Only continuity of `σ` at the point is used. -/

/-- **Precomposition with a map admitting an analytic left inverse is surjective on germs.**

A germ at `z` is represented by a holomorphic `t` on some `V ∋ z`; its preimage is the germ of
`t ∘ σ`, which is holomorphic on any open neighbourhood of `okaMapFun u z` where `σ` is analytic
and lands in `V` (`OkaAnalytic.comp_analyticOn`). That it *is* a preimage is the
left-inverse hypothesis, used on the neighbourhood of `z` where it holds. -/

/-- **A holomorphic map with an analytic local inverse at a point is an isomorphism on the stalk

`σ` is asked to be analytic at `okaMapFun u z` and to be a two-sided inverse of `okaMapFun u`
near the two points; the value `σ (okaMapFun u z) = z` is not a separate hypothesis, since it is
`hleft` at `z`.

This is the statement `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso`'s stalk field asks for, and the
first in this repository to produce an isomorphism of stalks which is neither an identity nor a
field of an `IsCutOutBy`. -/
