# The degree of a morphism of complex analytic spaces

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree` is the number of sheets of a finite étale morphism, as a
single natural number attached to the morphism rather than a theorem about a pair of points.

## Why this was declined before, and what discharges the objection

Four docstrings in this development used to record the absence of a `degree` function, with the
same two-part reason: a `Nat`-valued definition carries a **well-definedness obligation**, and
**nothing consumed one**. Both parts are answered here and neither is answered by fiat.

* The obligation is discharged by `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_eq_card_fiber`, which is
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.card_fiber_eq_of_isFiniteEtale` — constancy of the fibre over a
  preconnected base — read at the definition. Note the direction of the dependency: the definition
  below is made for *every* morphism and is well-behaved only under the hypotheses of that
  theorem, exactly as `Nat.card` is defined for every type and is informative only on a finite
  one.
* The consumer is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isHomeomorph_base_of_degree_eq_one`: a finite
  étale morphism of degree one has a homeomorphism for its underlying map. That statement cannot
  be phrased at all without a degree — "all fibres have the same size" does not say what the size
  is, and "this particular fibre is a singleton" is a statement about a point.

## The definition is an `iSup` and not a value at a chosen point

`⨆ y, Nat.card (f ⁻¹' {y})` needs no point of the target and no `[Nonempty Y]`, where
`Nat.card (f ⁻¹' {Classical.arbitrary Y})` would need one in the *definition* and thereby in the
statement of every lemma about it. The cost is that the two facts a reader wants are separate:

* over the empty target the value is `0`, since an `iSup` over an empty index type is `⊥`;
* over a non-empty target on which the fibre count is constant the value is that constant, which
  is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_eq_of_forall_card_fiber_eq` and is `ciSup_const`.

Everything below goes through the second of those, including the two computations. **No covering
map theory enters any of them except `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_eq_card_fiber`**, which
is the only statement here that needs the fibres to be *related* to each other rather than
computed one at a time.

## What is *not* proved, and it is the interesting half

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isHomeomorph_base_of_degree_eq_one` concludes a homeomorphism of
the **underlying spaces** and not an isomorphism of analytic spaces, although
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso` also carries an isomorphism on every stalk. The two
together ought to give an isomorphism, and the step from them to one is a comparison of sheaves
across a homeomorphism which this development does not have; `Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalIso.lean`
records the same gap from the other side. So `ComplexAnalytic.not_isIso_sq` is *not* reproved
here, and the degree of a morphism is at present a topological invariant of it.

Multiplicativity in a composite is not proved either. It is true, and the proof is a fibrewise
count over the intermediate space that has nothing to do with the material below.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree`: **the number of sheets**, as a natural number.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_eq_card_fiber`: it is the size of the fibre over any
  point, for a finite étale morphism over a preconnected base — the well-definedness statement.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_id` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_sigmaFold`: the degree of an identity is `1`, and the
  degree of the trivial `ι`-sheeted cover is `Nat.card ι`, so **every value is realised**.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.bijective_base_iff_degree_eq_one` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isHomeomorph_base_of_degree_eq_one`: **degree one means the
  underlying map is a homeomorphism.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_comp_of_bijective_base` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_isIso_comp`: **the degree does not see a change of source**
  — precomposing with a morphism that is bijective on points, in particular with an isomorphism,
  leaves it alone. This is what makes the degree an invariant of an *object* of the category of
  covers rather than of a morphism, which is where
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.degree`
  (`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`) reads it.

/-- **The degree, or number of sheets, of a morphism of complex analytic spaces**: the supremum
over the target of the number of points of a fibre.

The definition is made for an arbitrary morphism, with no hypothesis at all, and is informative
exactly when the fibre count is constant and finite —
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_eq_card_fiber` is that statement for a finite étale morphism
over a preconnected base, and is the well-definedness obligation the module docstring is about.

**Two junk values are folded into the one expression and they are different junk.** `Nat.card` of
an infinite fibre is `0`, and an `iSup` over an empty target — or over a family of fibre counts
that is unbounded — is `0` as well, since `ℕ` is a `ConditionallyCompleteLinearOrderBot`. Neither
is reachable under the hypotheses of the theorems below, and neither is repaired by choosing a
point of the target instead: that choice merely moves the empty case into the *statement* of every
lemma, as a `[Nonempty Y]` the definition would then need. -/

  ⨆ y : Y, Nat.card (f.toLRSHom.base ⁻¹' {y})

/-- **A morphism all of whose fibres have `n` points, over a non-empty target, has degree `n`.**

This is `ciSup_const` and nothing else; it is stated because every computation of a degree below
is an instance of it, and because it is where the `[Nonempty Y]` that
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree` deliberately does not carry has to be supplied.

The hypothesis is about each fibre separately, so no covering-space theory is involved and no
finiteness is asked of anything. -/

/-- **The degree of a finite étale morphism over a preconnected base is the number of points of

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree`.

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.card_fiber_eq_of_isFiniteEtale` says the fibre count is constant;
this says the constant is the degree. The point `y` supplies the `[Nonempty Y]` that
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_eq_of_forall_card_fiber_eq` needs, so no separate
non-emptiness hypothesis appears.

This is the only statement in this file that uses the covering-map theory; the two computations
below reach their fibre counts one point at a time and use none of it. -/

The anchor for the scale: every fibre of `𝟙 X` is a singleton, so
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_eq_of_forall_card_fiber_eq` applies with no hypothesis
beyond `[Nonempty X]`, and in particular without `[T2Space X]` or preconnectedness. On the empty
space the degree is `0` instead, which is the `iSup` convention and not a defect. -/

/-- **The trivial `ι`-sheeted cover has degree `Nat.card ι`.**

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.card_fiber_sigmaFold` computes each fibre separately, so this is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_eq_of_forall_card_fiber_eq` applied to it and there is no
analysis and no covering-space theory in it. `[Finite ι]` is not needed, for the same reason it is
not needed there — and for the same reason the statement says nothing for an infinite `ι`, both
sides being `0`.

`[Nonempty X]` is needed and is not decorative: over the empty space the coproduct is empty too
and the degree is `0`, while `Nat.card ι` need not be.

**Together with `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_id` this realises every value**: at
`ι = ULift (Fin n)` the degree is `n`, for every `n`, and the morphism is finite étale by
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_sigmaFold`. What it does not give is a *connected*
source, so the trivial covers say nothing about the degree of a cover that is not a disjoint union
of copies of its base; `ComplexAnalytic.degree_sq` is the witness for that. -/

    degree (sigmaFold ι X) = Nat.card ι :=
  degree_eq_of_forall_card_fiber_eq _ (card_fiber_sigmaFold X)

/-! ### Invariance under a change of source -/

/-- **Precomposing with a morphism that is bijective on points does not change the degree.**

Each fibre of `e ≫ f` over `y` is the `e`-preimage of the fibre of `f` over `y`, and a bijection
preserves `Nat.card` of a preimage (`Nat.card_preimage_of_injective`, whose second hypothesis
`s ⊆ Set.range _` is what surjectivity discharges); the two suprema are then equal term by term,
by `iSup_congr`, with no case split on finiteness and no `[Nonempty _]` anywhere.

**Bijectivity is not weakenable to either half.** Injectivity alone leaves a fibre of `f` that `e`
misses, whose points the left-hand count does not see; surjectivity alone lets two points of the
source lie over one, and the left-hand count is then too large. So this is one of the few places
in this development where `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.bijective_base_of_isIso` is wanted and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.surjective_base_of_isIso` is not enough.

**The hypothesis is on the base map alone and nothing sheaf-theoretic enters**, which is why this
is stated for an arbitrary morphism with a bijective base rather than for an isomorphism: the
isomorphism case is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_isIso_comp` below and is the corollary
every consumer wants.

**The `rw [degree, degree]` names a definition and costs nothing here**, which is worth saying
because `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumToBase.lean` states the opposite rule and it is the same
rule: naming a definition as a rewrite rule generates its equation lemma **once per definition,
not once per proof**, and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree.eq_1` is already in
`scripts/DumpOkaDecls.lean`'s output on this branch's base — generated by
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_eq_of_forall_card_fiber_eq` above, which spells its proof
the same way. Measured on both refs. Where the same spelling *would* have cost a row is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.degree_eq_of_iso`
(`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`), whose definition no other proof names, and that
docstring records the measurement. -/

/-- **Precomposing with an isomorphism does not change the degree.**

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_comp_of_bijective_base` at
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.bijective_base_of_isIso`, and nothing else. It asks nothing of `f`
— not finite, not étale, not a preconnected base — because the fibrewise argument above asks
nothing of it either.

**This is the statement that makes the degree an invariant of an object of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver`**: a morphism of covers over `X` is a triangle, so
an isomorphism of covers exhibits one structure map as an isomorphism precomposed with the other,
and this says the two structure maps then have the same degree. That consumer is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.degree_eq_of_iso`
(`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`).

**Postcomposition is a different statement and is not here, in either direction.**
`degree (f ≫ e) = degree f` for an isomorphism `e` relabels the *target*, so its proof would be a
reindexing of the supremum rather than the fibrewise argument above; **this file neither states
nor proves it**, and nothing below or downstream asks for it — a triangle over a fixed base
produces the precomposition and not this. -/

/-- **A finite étale morphism over a preconnected base has degree one exactly when its underlying
map is bijective.**

The consumer the earlier refusals of a `degree` function said did not exist. Both directions are
`Function.bijective_iff_forall_card_preimage_eq_one` — bijectivity of a map is precisely every
fibre having one point — together with
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_eq_card_fiber` to move between "every fibre" and "the
degree". The forward direction is the one that needs the constancy: from a single fibre of size
one it concludes the degree, and that step is the well-definedness theorem.

`[Nonempty Y]` is genuine on the right and invisible on the left: over the empty target every map
is bijective while the degree is `0`. -/

  rw [← degree_eq_card_fiber f y, h]

/-- **A finite étale morphism of degree one is a homeomorphism on the underlying spaces.**

The three inputs to `isHomeomorph_iff_continuous_isClosedMap_bijective` are, in order, the
continuity a `TopCat` morphism carries with it, the closedness field of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFinite`, and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.bijective_base_iff_degree_eq_one`. **The local-homeomorphism field
of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso` is not used**, and neither is the covering-map
theorem: a closed continuous bijection is a homeomorphism whether or not it is a local one.

**The conclusion is topological and is weaker than the expected one.** `IsLocalIso` also gives an
isomorphism on every stalk, and a homeomorphism together with stalkwise isomorphisms ought to give
an isomorphism of analytic spaces; the missing step is a comparison of the two structure sheaves
across the homeomorphism, which this development does not have. So this does not reprove
`ComplexAnalytic.not_isIso_sq`, and it is not the converse of anything stated here.

**One morphism of degree one is known to be an isomorphism, and it is not got this way.** The
trivial cover at one sheet is, by `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isIso_sigmaFold`
(`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SigmaFiniteEtale.lean`), whose proof is the universal property of the disjoint
union and reads no sheaf and no fibre — and it needs neither `[T2Space]` nor `[PreconnectedSpace]`
nor a degree. That is a fact about that one morphism and not about degree one; the missing step
above is still missing. -/
