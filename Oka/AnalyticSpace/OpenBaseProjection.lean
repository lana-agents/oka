# Over an open subset of the base: the projection of a cylinder

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/MonicProjection.lean` and `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimpleZeroStalk.lean` are the two
halves of *the analytification of a standard étale morphism is finite étale*, and both are stated
with `i` landing in the **whole** of `ℂ^(n+1)`. A standard étale algebra inverts a polynomial as
well as cutting one out, so its analytification lives in an open subspace, and each half says in
its own `## What is not here` that carrying it across a restriction is separate work. This file is
that work, for both at once, because both need the same object.

The object is the **cylinder** `V × ℂ` over an open `V ⊆ ℂ^n`, and the morphism is the projection
`ℂ^(n+1)|(V × ℂ) ⟶ ℂ^n|V` it carries.

## Why the cylinder is a preimage and not a product

`ComplexAnalytic.cylinder V` is defined as `(Opens.map (AnalyticSpace.proj n).toLRSHom.base).obj
V`, the preimage of `V` under the projection — **not** as a product of open sets, though
`ComplexAnalytic.mem_cylinder` says it is one. That is the whole design of this file: the preimage
is the spelling `ComplexAnalytic.restrictHom` asks for, so the projection over `V` is literally
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.proj` restricted, and everything already proved about a restricted
morphism applies to it with no transport:

* `ComplexAnalytic.base_restrictHom` computes its underlying map, which is what
  `ComplexAnalytic.base_projRestrict_eq` turns into the product reading;
* `ComplexAnalytic.stalkMap_restrictHom_eq'` factors its stalk map through
  `ComplexAnalytic.restrictStalkEquiv`, which is what the stalk half below is;
* `ComplexAnalytic.isClosedEmbedding_base_restrictHom` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.restrictOpen` are what a *chart* keeps, for a caller building the
  source.

A product definition would have bought the second reading and lost all three.

## `TopologicalSpace.Opens.extend'` is the same construction and is not usable here

`Oka/OkaRing.lean` already has the cylinder: `TopologicalSpace.Opens.extend'` takes
`Opens (Fin n → ℂ)` to `Opens (Fin (n + 1) → ℂ)`, with `TopologicalSpace.Opens.mem_extend'` the
`Fin.init` reading of the membership. It is indexed by `Fin n` and this file needs
`ULift (Fin n)`: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.complexAffineSpace n` is
`complexSpace (ULift (Fin n))`, so `extend'` does not typecheck against it, and nothing relabels
the two — `Oka/AnalyticSpace/ProjectionStalk.lean`'s module docstring records that there is no
morphism of spaces between the two spellings of `ℂ^n` above `Type 0`, which is why
`ComplexAnalytic.uliftCastSuccEmb` exists beside `ComplexAnalytic.projCoords` rather than being
derived from it. `extend'` is consumed by `Oka/Weierstrass.lean` and `Oka/Statement.lean`, both
`Fin`-indexed throughout, and by nothing on the `AnalyticSpace` side. So this is the second
cylinder for the same reason there are two projections, and the duplication is the `ULift` one
and not a fresh one.

## The finiteness half

`ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_comp_projRestrict_of_range_eq` is
`ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_comp_proj_of_range_eq` with `ComplexAnalytic.uliftSnocHomeo` replaced by
its restriction `ComplexAnalytic.cylinderHomeo`, and the proof is the same four steps.
**No new mirror-tree theorem was needed**: `Polynomial.isClosed_fst_image_of_monic` and
`Polynomial.finite_inter_fst_preimage_of_monic` are stated for an arbitrary topological parameter
space, so they are instantiated at `V` rather than at `ℂ^n`, and the family `q` is a family of
polynomials indexed by `V` — its coefficients are asked to be continuous on `V` and nowhere else.

The degree is still *fixed* and not merely bounded, and restricting the base does not change that:
a family whose leading coefficient degenerates has roots escaping to infinity and the projection is
then not closed.

## The stalk half

`ComplexAnalytic.bijective_stalkMap_comp_projRestrict` is
`ComplexAnalytic.bijective_stalkMap_comp_of_incl` — the abstract step, which is stated for
arbitrary locally ringed spaces and so needs no restricting — at two identifications of the two
stalks with `LocalOkaRing`s. Those identifications are the content:

* `ComplexAnalytic.cylinderStalkEquiv` is the stalk of `𝒪_{ℂ^(n+1)}` at the point below, reached
  through the inverse of the stalk map of the inclusion of the open subspace, which is an
  isomorphism by `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isIso_stalkMap_ofRestrict`. That instance and
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.restrictStalkIso` are the same isomorphism at two
  spellings, and the one used here is the one a caller of `ofRestrict` already holds; the named
  `Iso` is never built, because what the `RingEquiv` needs is `asIso` of the instance;
* `ComplexAnalytic.baseStalkEquiv` is the same for the base, through
  `ComplexAnalytic.restrictStalkEquiv`, which `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Restrict.lean` already built for
  exactly this factorisation.

**Both bullets name declarations rather than another file's prose, and that is deliberate.** The
first used to say that `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimpleZeroStalk.lean` *names* this isomorphism *as
missing*; that file now says the opposite in terms, and the clause went stale on the day its
paragraph was rewritten. A cross-reference that quotes another file's stance goes stale every
time that stance moves; one that names a declaration does not.

**The two coefficient forms are the same trade as on the whole of `ℂ^(n+1)`**, and they are here
rather than one file up because the order form is what the abstract step delivers:
`MvPowerSeries.order_partialEval_eq_one_iff` splits the order into a vanishing condition and one
coefficient, and the vanishing is free — it says the cutting function vanishes at the point, which
`ComplexAnalytic.evalHom_eq_zero_of_isCutOutBy_resΓ` derives from `hcut`. They ask their cutting
section to be a restriction, which the order form does not, because that is what
`ComplexAnalytic.cylinderStalkEquiv_Γgerm_resΓ` needs in order to compute the germ at all.

`ComplexAnalytic.cylinderStalkEquiv_stalkMap_projRestrict` is then the `hP` hypothesis of the
abstract step and is where `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.okaStalkEquiv_stalkMap_uliftProj_apply`
enters; the two cut-out hypotheses go through unchanged, since
`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.surjective_stalkMap` and
`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.mem_ker_stalkMap_iff` are about the source of `i` and not about its
target.

## Reading the cutting section

The cutting section `F` is a global section of `𝒪` of the **cylinder subspace**, and that ring is
not `OkaRing (cylinder V)`: the restricted presheaf sends `⊤` to
`Subtype.val '' Set.univ`, which is equal to `cylinder V` and not definitionally so (measured:
`rfl` fails on the two rings). So a germ of `F` is not a Taylor series until something says which
function `F` is. `ComplexAnalytic.cylinderStalkEquiv_Γgerm_resΓ` and
`ComplexAnalytic.range_base_eq_of_isCutOutBy_resΓ` say it for the case the standard étale line
produces — `F` the restriction of an entire function `G`, which is what a polynomial equation
gives — and they are what make the simple-zero hypothesis and the cut-out hypothesis checkable.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.cylinder`: **the cylinder `V × ℂ` over an open subset of `ℂ^n`**, as an open
  subset of `ℂ^(n+1)`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.projRestrict`: **the projection `ℂ^(n+1)|(V × ℂ) ⟶ ℂ^n|V`**, as a
  morphism of complex analytic spaces.
- `ComplexAnalytic.cylinderHomeo`: **the cylinder is homeomorphic to `V × ℂ`**, by the
  restriction of `ComplexAnalytic.uliftSnocHomeo`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.cylinderStalkEquiv` and `ComplexAnalytic.baseStalkEquiv`: the stalks of the two
  open subspaces, as `LocalOkaRing`s.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.mem_cylinder`: the cylinder is the product, read through
  `ComplexAnalytic.uliftSnocHomeo`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.base_projRestrict_eq`: **the projection over `V` is `Prod.fst`** through
  `ComplexAnalytic.cylinderHomeo`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.Γgerm_resΓ_mem_maximalIdeal_iff`: **the germ of a restricted entire function
  lies in the maximal ideal exactly where the function vanishes** — the pointwise statement both
  of the two below are read off, in both directions.
- `ComplexAnalytic.range_base_eq_of_isCutOutBy_resΓ`: a hypersurface of the cylinder cut out by
  the restriction of an entire function has that function's zero set for its image.
- `ComplexAnalytic.evalHom_eq_zero_of_isCutOutBy_resΓ`: **that function vanishes at every point of
  the hypersurface it cuts out**, which is what makes the vanishing half of the simple-zero
  hypothesis free rather than asked for.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_comp_projRestrict_of_range_eq`: **the projection of a monic
  hypersurface of the cylinder to `V` is finite.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_comp_projRestrict_of_isCutOutBy`: the same with the hypersurface
  presented as a cut-out by one restricted entire function.
- `ComplexAnalytic.cylinderStalkEquiv_stalkMap_projRestrict`: **the stalk map of the projection
  over `V` is the inclusion of the germs not involving the last variable**, once both stalks are
  read as germ rings by the two equivalences above.
- `ComplexAnalytic.cylinderStalkEquiv_stalkMap_ofRestrict` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.cylinderStalkEquiv_Γgerm_resΓ`: what
  `ComplexAnalytic.cylinderStalkEquiv` does to the stalk map of the inclusion, and to the germ of
  a restricted entire function.
- `ComplexAnalytic.bijective_stalkMap_comp_projRestrict` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.isIso_stalkMap_comp_projRestrict`: **the projection of a hypersurface of the
  cylinder with a simple zero is an isomorphism on stalks.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.bijective_stalkMap_comp_projRestrict_of_coeff` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.isIso_stalkMap_comp_projRestrict_of_coeff`: **the same hypothesis as one
  coefficient** — the coefficient of the last variable in the Taylor expansion at the point of the
  entire function the hypersurface is cut out by — which is the form
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenBaseProjectionPolynomial.lean` reads as a derivative.

## What is not here

* **No derivative hypothesis, and it is not absent from the repository.** The two coefficient
  forms below are as far as this file goes; reading that coefficient as
  `MvPolynomial.pderiv` at the point needs `Oka/Polynomial/Germ.lean`, which this file does not
  import, and the four-line rewrite is
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenBaseProjectionPolynomial.lean`. The same split, for the same reason, as
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimpleZeroStalk.lean` against `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimpleZeroPolynomial.lean`.
* **No `IsFiniteEtale`, and no `IsLocalIso`.** The two halves are transported separately and
  nothing below joins them; that is the assembly the Riemann-existence line does, and it needs a
  third thing neither half supplies — that the underlying map of the composite is a local
  homeomorphism. As on the whole of `ℂ^(n+1)`, a monic family with repeated roots gives a
  composite that is not one, so this is not a gap that closes by an argument of the same kind.
* **No Weierstrass polynomial, and the family is still a hypothesis in this file.** It is one
  here exactly as it is in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/MonicProjection.lean`, and no holomorphy of its
  coefficients is used or asked for below — continuity is all the proofs consume.
  **What is no longer absent from the repository is the extraction**:
  `ComplexAnalytic.okaFamily` in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/HolomorphicFamily.lean`, which imports this
  file, produces a family satisfying all three hypotheses from a monic
  `P : Polynomial (OkaRing V)`. What is still missing there and here is the step before that, a
  `P` obtained from a *germ* by the Weierstrass preparation theorem.
* **Nothing about a section of the cylinder that does not extend.** The two `resΓ` lemmas above
  read a cutting section that is the restriction of an entire function. A section of
  `𝒪_{ℂ^(n+1)}` over the cylinder that extends to no larger open set is allowed by every
  statement below and computed by none of them. **What
  `ComplexAnalytic.cylinderSection` in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/HolomorphicFamily.lean` adds is the
  construction and not the example**: it builds a section of the cylinder out of a
  `Polynomial (OkaRing V)`, whose coefficients live on `V` and are required to extend nowhere,
  and it pays for that by taking its hypersurface as a range condition rather than as a
  `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy` datum, for the reason this bullet gives. **Whether any output of
  it fails to extend is settled nowhere**: the coefficients of the one such polynomial this
  repository writes down are entire, which `OkaTest/HolomorphicFamily.lean` records.
* **No second restriction, and in particular nothing about a restriction of the *source*.** `V` is
  an open subset of `ℂ^n` and `ComplexAnalytic.cylinder V` is its preimage, so every statement
  below restricts the base and pulls back. There is no statement about restricting `V` further,
  which would be `ComplexAnalytic.restrictHom` again and is not needed by anything — **and none
  about an open subset of `ℂ^(n+1)` that is not a preimage**, which is the shape the standard
  étale line actually presents: `D(G)` for a `G` involving the fibre variable is not a cylinder
  over anything. Reading the paragraph at the top of this file as covering that case is the trap
  taxis #1112's description names, and nothing below closes it.

/-! ### Finiteness of the projection over `V` -/

/-- **The germ of a restricted entire function lies in the maximal ideal of the stalk of the
cylinder subspace exactly where the function vanishes.**

`germ_mem_maximalIdeal_iff` is the same statement on the ambient `ℂ^(n+1)`, and
the step between them is that the germ of the *restricted* section is the image of the ambient
germ under the stalk map of the inclusion of the open subspace, which is an isomorphism and so
reflects the maximal ideal (`ComplexAnalytic.mem_maximalIdeal_stalkMap_iff`).

**It is stated as an `Iff` and at a point rather than inside the range computation below**, which
is where it used to live as a `have`. Both directions are consumed: the forward one is what makes
the vanishing half of the simple-zero hypothesis free — see
`ComplexAnalytic.evalHom_eq_zero_of_isCutOutBy_resΓ` — and the backward one is what puts a point
*into* a hypersurface of the cylinder, which is what `OkaTest/OpenBaseProjection.lean` needs to
exhibit the stalk hypothesis at all.

**The cutting section is `G` restricted and not an arbitrary section of the cylinder.** That is
not a convenience: the global sections of the cylinder subspace are not `OkaRing (cylinder V)` on
the nose, so `germ_mem_maximalIdeal_iff` does not apply to a section that is not a restriction.

variable (V : TopologicalSpace.Opens (ULift.{u} (Fin n) → ℂ))

/-- **The stalk of `𝒪` of the cylinder subspace at a point, as a `LocalOkaRing`.**

Three steps: the inclusion of an open subspace is an isomorphism on stalks
(`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isIso_stalkMap_ofRestrict`), so its inverse identifies this stalk
with the ambient one; `okaStalkEquiv` reads that as `LocalOkaRing (ULift (Fin (n+1)))`; and
`LocalOkaRing.uliftEquiv` relabels the index type to the one the Weierstrass theorems use. Only
the first step is new here. -/

/-- **The stalk of `𝒪` of the base subspace at the image point, as a `LocalOkaRing`.**

The same three steps, with `ComplexAnalytic.restrictStalkEquiv` in place of the inverse stalk map
— that composite is what `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Restrict.lean` built for exactly this factorisation,
and using it is what makes `ComplexAnalytic.cylinderStalkEquiv_stalkMap_projRestrict` two
rewrites. -/

/-- **`ComplexAnalytic.cylinderStalkEquiv` undoes the stalk map of the inclusion**: on a germ that
comes from the ambient space it is `okaStalkEquiv` followed by the index relabelling, with the
inverse stalk map gone. Two of the equivalence's three steps survive, not one — the relabelling is
what puts the answer in the index type the Weierstrass side uses. -/
