# An open subspace of a complex analytic space is a complex analytic space

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrict X U` is the open subspace of `X` on an open subset `U`:
the locally ringed space `X|U`, with the `ℂ`-algebra structure obtained by restricting sections,
and — which is the content — a chart at every one of its points.
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofRestrict` is its inclusion into `X`, as a morphism of complex
analytic spaces.

Until this file there was no `AnalyticSpace.restrict`: `LocallyRingedSpace.restrict` appeared
only *inside* the statement of what a chart is, never as a construction producing an analytic
space. (Checked by grep against `85b9251`: the only occurrence of the name was in
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Restrict.lean`'s docstring, saying it was missing.)

## Why it is not immediate

A chart of `X` at a point of `U` is a closed immersion `i : X|U₀ ⟶ ℂ^n|V` for some open
neighbourhood `U₀` of that point in `X`. What `AnalyticSpace.local_model` wants for `X|U` is a
chart on an open neighbourhood **inside `U`**, and its target must again be `ℂ^n` restricted to
an open subset **of `ℂ^n`**. Three things have to happen.

* **The chart must be shrunk to the overlap.** `i` is a closed embedding, hence an embedding, so
  the preimage of `U` in `X|U₀` is the preimage of some open `V'` of `ℂ^n|V`
  (`IsInducing.isOpen_iff`) — and `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.restrictOpen` then cuts out the
  overlap inside `ℂ^n|V|V'` by the restricted family. **`V'` is obtained rather than
  constructed**: the topological input is that an embedding's opens all come from the target.
* **The source has to be recognised as an open subspace of `X|U` rather than of `X|U₀`.** Both
  `X|U|W` and `X|U₀|W₀` are open immersions into `X` with the same image — the overlap — so
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion.isoOfRangeEq` identifies them. No
  `restrictRestrict` is needed.
* **The target has to be flattened.** `ℂ^n|V|V'` and `ℂ^n|V''`, for `V''` the image of `V'` in
  `ℂ^n`, are again two open immersions into `ℂ^n` with the same image, so the same lemma
  applies; and `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.iso_comp` transports the cut-out along it.

The `ℂ`-linearity of both identifications is `ComplexAnalytic.IsCLinearHom.of_comp`: each is a
morphism *over* the ambient space, and every algebra structure in sight is the ambient one
restricted, so linearity is contravariant functoriality of `Γ` applied to the factorisation. No
transport of algebra structures along an isomorphism is needed anywhere.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrict`: **an open subspace of a complex analytic space is a
  complex analytic space.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofRestrict`: its inclusion, as a morphism of complex analytic
  spaces.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictLE`: the inclusion of a smaller open subspace into a
  larger one, as a morphism of complex analytic spaces.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftRestrict`: **a morphism whose image lies in an open subspace
  factors through it**, as a morphism of complex analytic spaces. This is what builds a morphism
  whose *target* is an open subspace; `restrictLE` is its special case at an inclusion.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictHom`: **a morphism restricted to the preimage of an open
  subset of the target**, as a morphism of complex analytic spaces. This is the other way to land
  in an open subspace, and it asks nothing of the image: `liftRestrict` keeps the source and needs
  the image to lie in `V`, this shrinks the source to the preimage of `V` instead.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftTop`: **the section of the inclusion at an open that is
  everything**, which is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftRestrict` at the identity.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.resΓ`: the restriction of a global section of `𝒪_X` to an open
  subspace.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.exists_local_model_restrict`: the chart of `X|U` at a point, which is the
  `local_model` field of `AnalyticSpace.restrict`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isIso_stalkMap_ofRestrict`: **the inclusion of an open subspace
  is an isomorphism on stalks**, at the spelling a caller of `ofRestrict` holds. Mathlib has the
  statement; what this adds is a discrimination-tree key, exactly as
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isOpenImmersion_ofRestrict` does one field further in.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_ofRestrict`: **the inclusion of an open subspace is a
  local isomorphism.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictHom_comp`: **restricting a composite is composing the
  restrictions.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_restrictHom_of_subset_range`: **a morphism whose base is
  an embedding restricts to a finite morphism over any open subset of its image** — the shape an
  *open* immersion needs, since it is finite over such a subset and is not finite at all.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_restrictHom`: **a local isomorphism restricted over an
  open subset of the target is a local isomorphism**, with no hypothesis on the morphism or the
  open beyond that. Unlike the bullet above this needs nothing of the base map's image, because
  both fields are local at a point and a restriction changes neither.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.mono_ofRestrict`: **the inclusion of an open subspace is a
  monomorphism**, reflected along the faithful forgetful functor.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isIso_ofRestrict_of_eq_univ`: **it is an isomorphism when the
  open is everything.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftTop_comp_restrictHom_top`: **a morphism is its own
  restriction over `⊤`, conjugated by two inclusions** — which is what carries a property of
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictHom f ⊤` back to `f`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_restrictHom_top`: **a morphism whose restriction over
  `⊤` is finite is finite**, which is that transfer at the one property two `## What is not here`
  bullets elsewhere were asking about.

## Why `Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalIso.lean` is imported here, when no import was forced

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_ofRestrict` needs `ofRestrict`, defined here, and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso`, defined there. **That does not mean one of the two
files had to import the other, and an earlier draft of this paragraph said it did.** Three files
already reach both: `Oka/AnalyticSpace/CoveringSpace.lean`, `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Degree.lean` and
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SigmaFiniteEtale.lean`. Any of them would have cost **nothing**. **None of the
three is where the instance is used**, and that draft said the first of them was: the only
consumer of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_ofRestrict` anywhere is
`OkaTest/CoveringSpace.lean`, which imports `Oka` wholesale and so finds it wherever it sits.

**This paragraph also said the import "can be undone by moving one instance", and that is no
longer true.** `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_restrictHom` below is a second
declaration in this file whose statement mentions `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso`, and
unlike the instance above it has a consumer **under `Oka/`** —
`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleFiniteEtale.lean` — rather than only in the test library. So
undoing the edge now means moving two declarations and giving that consumer an import it does not
have. The edge is still cheap, for the reason measured below; what it is no longer is free.

**It is here because both of its ingredients are.** The first field is
`Topology.IsOpenEmbedding.isLocalHomeomorph` at `U.isOpenEmbedding`; the second is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isIso_stalkMap_ofRestrict` three declarations above, found by
`inferInstance` — a lemma that exists *only* to put Mathlib's statement at the
discrimination-tree key a caller of `ofRestrict` holds. Putting its one consumer in another file
is how such a lemma comes to look unused. The statement is also about open subspaces and not about
covering spaces: a `## Main results` bullet in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/CoveringSpace.lean` reading *the
inclusion of an open subspace is a local isomorphism* would be a claim in the wrong file.

**What the edge costs, and what the reverse would have.** Transitive closure of each file's import
list, expanding and counting **only modules under `Oka/` and `Mathlib/`** — other packages are
leaves and are dropped, which is the convention `scripts/import_cost.py` states as *"Mathlib
modules only"*, widened to this repository:

* this file, **3095 → 3100**, and the five are named: `Oka.AnalyticSpace.LocalIso`,
  `Oka.AnalyticSpace.Finite`, `Mathlib.Topology.IsLocalHomeomorph`,
  `Mathlib.Topology.OpenPartialHomeomorph.Composition`, `Mathlib.Topology.SeparatedMap`;
* `Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalIso.lean`, **2160 → 3100**, since this file reaches
  `Oka.AnalyticSpace.Coherent` and the whole local-model apparatus.

**Five against 940 is the comparison, and it is what decided the direction.**

**Read the closures off Lean's own environment rather than off a parser over the header lines.**
The figures above are `lake env lean` on a scratch file whose imports are the list being measured,
with

```
open Lean in
#eval show CoreM Unit from do
  let ms := (← getEnv).header.moduleNames
  IO.println (ms.filter fun m => (`Oka).isPrefixOf m || (`Mathlib).isPrefixOf m).size
```

That is not fussiness. An earlier draft of this section gave 3075 and 2141 from a parser of its
own, and three hand-written parsers — that one and two reviewers' — disagreed with each other and
with Lean before the environment settled it. Three traps account for the spread and none of them
announces itself: matching the word *import* outside the header picks it up inside a docstring
code block and pulls in the whole of Mathlib; **seventy** Mathlib header lines carry a trailing
*shake* comment — `grep -rlE '^module[ \t]+--' .lake/packages/mathlib/Mathlib/`, in five
spellings — so a parser comparing the stripped line against the module keyword stops at each of
them, and one of the seventy is `Mathlib/Tactic/Common.lean`, which by itself takes the tactic
modules with it; and this Mathlib writes both *public meta import* and *import all*, which a
pattern anchored on the bare keyword misses.
`scripts/import_cost.py` cannot be used instead — it resolves only under `Mathlib/`, and neither
of these two files is a mirror file.

**All four figures are counterfactual, so recomputing them here needs the import above removed
first** — left in place the first reads `3100 → 3100`, and the second `3101`, one more, because
the union then contains `Oka.AnalyticSpace.LocalIso` itself. The five-module delta is what the
decision rests on and it is convention-invariant; the baselines are not.

`ComplexAnalytic.isCLinearHom_restrictHom`, whose two algebra structures are the two
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrict` puts on the two open subspaces, so nothing is
transported.

Unlike `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftRestrict` this does not ask the image of `A` to lie in
`V`: it shrinks the *source* to the preimage instead. Neither is a special case of the other.

**The name shadows `ComplexAnalytic.restrictHom` inside `namespace AnalyticSpace`** — sixteen
files, and not the bulk of the development, which is written one namespace up in
`ComplexAnalytic`, where the bare name still resolves to the locally-ringed-space one. That is why
exactly one existing call site needed qualifying rather than dozens. A use of the bare name inside
`AnalyticSpace` now means this one; the locally-ringed-space one has to be written
`ComplexAnalytic.restrictHom`, as it is in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/HolomorphicMapGeneral.lean`. That is
the price of the name matching the one it wraps, and the mismatch is a type error rather than a
silent change of meaning: the two have different sources and targets.

**Count the sixteen with `grep -rlE '^namespace (ComplexAnalytic\.)?AnalyticSpace'`.** Nine of
them open `namespace AnalyticSpace` and seven open `namespace ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`

`ComplexAnalytic.isClosedEmbedding_base_restrictHom_of_subset_range` and

**It is stated because the unrestricted morphism is usually not finite and this is not a weakening
of a stronger fact.** The case it exists for is an *open* immersion: `X.ofRestrict U` is never a
closed map unless `U` is clopen, so `IsFinite` of it is false in general, and yet its restriction
over a `V` contained in `U` is finite — the two ranges then agree and the restricted map is a
homeomorphism. That is what
`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleFiniteness.lean` spends, and it is why the hypothesis is on `V`
rather than on the morphism.

The import that makes this statable is `Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalIso.lean`'s, whose closure carries
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Finite.lean`; the section above prices that edge for a different reason and
this is a second consumer of it. -/

Nothing about the morphism is asked and nothing about the open subset is: both fields of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso` are conditions at a point, and a restriction changes
the point's neighbourhoods on neither side. **That is what separates this from
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_restrictHom_of_subset_range` above**, whose hypothesis is
there because finiteness is not local on the target: the inclusion of an open subspace restricts
to a finite morphism only over a `V` inside its image, and is a local isomorphism over every `V`.

**The topological field is the commuting square and not a lemma about restrictions.**
`ComplexAnalytic.base_restrictHom` says `ofRestrict V ∘ restrictHom f V = f ∘ ofRestrict (f⁻¹ V)`
on points; the right-hand side is a local homeomorphism because both factors are, and
`IsLocalHomeomorph.of_comp` then peels off the left factor, which is one because
`Topology.IsOpenEmbedding.isLocalHomeomorph` applies to `V.isOpenEmbedding`. The continuity
`of_comp` asks for is the base map's own.

**The stalk field is a term and not a `rw`, and that is forced.**
`ComplexAnalytic.stalkMap_restrictHom_eq'` already writes the stalk map as an isomorphism, then
`f`'s stalk map, then an isomorphism, so instance search closes it once that factorisation is in
the goal — but `rw` fails to find the pattern, because `V : B.Opens` elaborates at the `toTopCat`
spelling of the carrier while the lemma wants `Opens ↑B.toTopCat` reached through
`toPresheafedSpace`. That seam runs through this corner of the tree and
`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleFiniteness.lean` records two more instances of it. -/

An `abbrev` rather than a `def`, so that a caller holding

/-- **Restricting twice is restricting once.**

Spelled at the level of locally ringed spaces throughout — `Γ.map` of the underlying morphism
rather than of the morphism of analytic spaces. That is not cosmetic: the same proof written
against `X.restrictLE h` and `X.ofRestrict W` as morphisms of analytic spaces **exceeds the
default heartbeat budget**, because unifying `(f ≫ g).toLRSHom` with `f.toLRSHom ≫ g.toLRSHom`
forces the category instance open at every step.

**Measured 2026-08-31**, by replacing the `congrArg` below with one whose motive is over
`X.restrict V ⟶ X` and whose argument is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictLE_fac` rather
than `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.restrictLE_fac`:
`(deterministic) timeout at whnf, maximum number of heartbeats (200000)`, reached in 20s.
**200000 is the budget in force** — `lakefile.toml` sets no `maxHeartbeats`, so a figure of a
million, which this paragraph gave until today, names a budget nobody set.

**Unlike the seam in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Glue.lean`, this one is not known to be merely
expensive.** There the same counterfactual under `set_option maxHeartbeats 0` finishes, at about
eight times the file; here it was still elaborating after 21m29s and 5.4GB and was stopped, so
nothing measured says it terminates and nothing says it does not. -/

/-- **A morphism whose image lies in an open subspace factors through it**, as a morphism of
complex analytic spaces.

`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.liftRestrict` at the underlying morphisms. It is `ℂ`-linear
for the same reason `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictLE` is, and by the same lemma: the
factorisation makes it a morphism *over* `X`, `φ` is `ℂ`-linear by assumption and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofRestrict` by construction, so
`ComplexAnalytic.IsCLinearHom.of_comp` applies. Nothing is transported.

**This is the construction that builds a morphism whose *target* is an open subspace.** Before it,
everything here produced morphisms *out* of a restriction — `ofRestrict`, `restrictLE`,
`ComplexAnalytic.localisationProj` — and `restrictLE` was the only one landing in a restriction,
at the special case where the source is one too and the map is an inclusion. -/

/-! ### The open subspace at an open that is everything -/

/-- **The inclusion of an open subspace is a monomorphism.**

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.forgetToLocallyRingedSpace` is faithful and a faithful functor
*reflects* monomorphisms, so this is `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.ofRestrict`'s own
`Mono` instance carried back. **Nothing is transported and no `ℂ`-linearity is checked**: a
monomorphism is a cancellation property of the category, not structure on the morphism.

**The `show` is load-bearing and is the seam this file's neighbours already record.**
`forgetToLocallyRingedSpace.map (X.ofRestrict U)` and
`X.toLocallyRingedSpace.ofRestrict U.isOpenEmbedding` are `rfl`-equal and are *different
discrimination-tree keys*, so `infer_instance` finds the Mathlib instance only at the second
spelling. `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_of_isIso`'s docstring calls that its third
appearance; this is the fourth. **The step is a `change` and not a `show`**: the two spellings are
`rfl`-equal but not syntactically equal, so `linter.style.show` fires and `lake build --wfail`
turns the warning into an error, which `lake env lean` on a scratch file does not.

Before this, `Mono` of an inclusion was available in this repository only through
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace`, so a cancellation argument at the analytic level had to
be routed through the underlying morphisms by hand. -/

/-- **The section of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofRestrict` at an open that is everything**:
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftRestrict` applied to the identity, whose range condition is
then `Set.range id ⊆ Set.univ`.

**The hypothesis is `(U : Set X) = Set.univ` and not `U = ⊤`, deliberately**, and it is the
difference between this being usable and not. A caller holding
`(Opens.map f.toLRSHom.base).obj ⊤` — which is what
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictHom` produces at `⊤` — can discharge the set-level equality
by `rfl` and keep the open it already has. Stating it at `U = ⊤` instead forces the caller to
transport `X.restrict ((Opens.map f.toLRSHom.base).obj ⊤)` to `X.restrict ⊤`, and **those two are
`rfl`-equal but not type-correct at `instances` transparency**: the resulting goal elaborates and
then `rw` reports *"Did not find an occurrence of the pattern"* with an application type mismatch
underneath. Taking the open as a parameter removes the transport rather than discharging it. -/

/-- **`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftTop` is a section of the inclusion**, which is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftRestrict_fac` at the identity, **as a term and not as a
`simpa [liftTop]`**: naming the definition asks Lean to generate its equation lemma, and here it
planted two rows in this module's declaration dump — `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftTop.eq_1`
and a `congr_simp` under `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftRestrict`, a definition declared thirty
lines above. The term goes through definitional unfolding and generates neither. -/

/-- **The inclusion of an open subspace at an open that is everything is an isomorphism.**

One composite is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftTop_ofRestrict`; the other follows from it by
cancelling the mono `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.mono_ofRestrict`, which is why that instance is
above rather than elsewhere.

**Not an `instance`**: `hU` occurs in no instance-implicit argument and in no index of the
conclusion, so Lean rejects the declaration outright — *"1 argument that cannot be inferred using
typeclass synthesis"*. Callers use `haveI`. -/

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_restrictHom_top` below and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_of_restrictHom_top` in

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictHom f ⊤` to the same property of `f` whenever the property
respects isomorphisms and is stable under composition.

**`h` is `rfl`** at every `f` — the preimage of `⊤` is `Set.univ` on the nose — and is taken as a
hypothesis rather than proved here so that the open stays the one
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictHom` produced, for the reason

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftTop_comp_restrictHom_top` conjugated by the two isomorphisms,
with `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_comp` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_isIso` doing the transfer. **`IsFinite` is not a
`CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty` in this repository** — only the class is — so this is
`inferInstance` over `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_comp`, which *is* an instance, rather
than the `RespectsIso` route the finite étale version in
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean` takes. The two `haveI`s are what instance search cannot
find on its own: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_isIso` is a theorem and not an
instance, so the isomorphisms have to be fed in by hand.

**This is the version two `## What is not here` bullets were about**, and they were about
finiteness rather than about finite étaleness:
`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleFiniteness.lean`'s *"nothing in this repository relates the two
at `V = ⊤`"* and `OkaTest/StandardEtaleNotFinite.lean`'s `V`-irredundance bullet both name
`ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_restrictHom_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_comp`. The finite étale
statement alone would not have retired either. -/
