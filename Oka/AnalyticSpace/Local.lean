# Being a complex analytic space is a local condition

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` is a locally ringed space carrying two further things: a
`ℂ`-algebra structure `algebraMap` on its global sections, which is **data**, and the
`local_model` field, which is a **property**. This file isolates the property as a predicate
`ComplexAnalytic.HasLocalModels` and proves that it is local on the space: a locally ringed
space covered by open subspaces that have charts has charts.

`local_model` is stated pointwise — *every point has a neighbourhood carrying a chart* — so
locality is not surprising. What makes it a theorem rather than a triviality is that the chart
produced by the hypothesis lives on a restriction of a restriction, `(X|Uᵢ)|W`, while the
conclusion wants one on a single restriction `X|W'`. Those two are isomorphic and not equal,
and the isomorphism has to be checked `ℂ`-linear before the chart can be transported along it.

## Why this file exists

Every statement about gluing complex analytic spaces needs it. `Oka/Geometry/RingedSpace/
PresheafedSpace/Gluing.lean` supplies `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.OpenCover` and
identifies a locally ringed space with the gluing of a cover of it, so the locally-ringed-space
half of gluing is available; what is missing to glue *analytic* spaces is this property being
local, together with the `ℂ`-algebra structure of a glued space.

**Both are here.** They behave differently and that is why they are separated: `local_model` is a
*property* and is local, while `algebraMap` is *data* and lands in **global** sections, so it does
not restrict from a cover for free — recovering it from structures on the members is a gluing,
and it is `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.glueAlgMap`, which lives in the mirror tree
because nothing about it is analytic. `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofOpensCompatible` is the two
halves together.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.HasLocalModels`: the `local_model` field of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`,
  as a predicate on a locally ringed space together with a `ℂ`-algebra structure on its global
  sections.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofOpens`: a locally ringed space covered by open subspaces that
  have local models, as a complex analytic space, for a `ℂ`-algebra structure given on the
  ambient space.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofOpensCompatible`: the same with the `ℂ`-algebra structure
  given on the **members** of the cover and glued, which is the form a gluing construction
  produces.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.HasLocalModels.restrict`: an open subspace of a space with local models has
  local models. This is `ComplexAnalytic.exists_local_model_restrict` restated, and it is the
  hard direction.
- `ComplexAnalytic.HasLocalModels.of_iSup_eq_top`: **having local models is local** — a space
  covered by open subspaces that have local models has local models.
- `ComplexAnalytic.hasLocalModels_iff_iSup_eq_top`: the two together.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.map_ofOpensCompatible_algebraMap`: the glued `ℂ`-algebra
  structure restricts to the given one on each member of the cover.

## What is not here

* **`ℂ`-linearity of the transition maps as a hypothesis.** `ofOpensCompatible` asks only that
  the algebra structures agree on the overlaps, spelled as `TopCat.Presheaf.IsCompatible`, which
  is all the sheaf condition needs. A formulation in terms of `ComplexAnalytic.IsCLinearHom` of
  the inclusions would be equivalent and is not stated, because nothing produces its hypothesis
  in that shape.
* **Gluing along abstract open immersions rather than open subsets.** The cover here is a family
  of `TopologicalSpace.Opens X`, not an `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.OpenCover`, whose
  members are arbitrary spaces mapping in by open immersions. Bridging the two needs the
  transport of `HasLocalModels` along a `ℂ`-linear isomorphism, which is not stated here because
  nothing yet needs it; `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.comp_iso` is the ingredient. **This is now
  the one thing between this file and gluing an analytic space out of an
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData`**, since
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.OpenCover.isIso_fromGlued` already identifies a space
  with the gluing of a cover of it.

of some `ℂ^n`.

This is the `local_model` field of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` verbatim, extracted so that
it can be *hypothesised* about a locally ringed space that is not yet packaged as an analytic
space — which is what every construction of an analytic space out of pieces needs. The

Given `x`, pick a member `U i` containing it and a chart of `X|U i` at `x`, defined on some
`W : Opens (X|U i)`. That chart is not yet a chart of `X`: it lives on `(X|U i)|W`, and what is
wanted is a chart on `X|W'` for `W'` the image of `W` in `X`. The two are open subspaces of `X`
with the same image, so `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion.isoOfRangeEq`
identifies them; that identification is `ℂ`-linear because both of its legs are inclusions of
open subspaces (`ComplexAnalytic.IsCLinearHom.of_comp` applied to
`ComplexAnalytic.isCLinearHom_ofRestrict`), and `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.comp_iso` carries
the chart across it. -/

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofOpens` takes the `ℂ`-algebra structure on the *ambient* space

and glues them with `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.glueAlgMap`. That is the form a gluing
construction produces, because the pieces are what one has and the ambient space is what one is
building.

The algebra structures are indexed by `U i` rather than by `(U i).functor.obj ⊤`, which is how
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.resAlgMap` indexes them; the restriction map between the
two is what the hypothesis `h` carries, and
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.resAlgMap_glueAlgMap` is what crosses it. -/
