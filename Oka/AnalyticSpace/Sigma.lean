# The disjoint union of a family of complex analytic spaces

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofOpenCover` builds an analytic space from a cover of a locally
ringed space by abstract spaces mapping in by open immersions. The inclusions of a coproduct are
such a cover — `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.sigmaOpenCover` — so a disjoint union of
analytic spaces is one application of it, once its compatibility hypothesis is discharged.

**That hypothesis is the whole of the work, and disjointness is the whole of the hypothesis.**
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofOpenCover` asks for `TopCat.Presheaf.IsCompatible`: the
`ℂ`-algebra structures carried from the members must agree on the pairwise intersections of the
members' images. For a coproduct those intersections are `⊥` for `i ≠ j`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.disjoint_opensRange_sigmaOpenCover`), and the sections of a
sheaf over `⊥` form the terminal ring, so any two of them agree; for `i = j` the two restrictions
are the same map. There is no analysis and no sheaf argument in it.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.sigma`: **the disjoint union**, whose underlying locally ringed
  space is the coproduct on the nose.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.sigmaι`: the inclusion of a member, as a morphism of analytic
  spaces.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.sigmaDesc`: the morphism out of a disjoint union determined by a
  morphism out of each member.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.cofanSigma`: the inclusions read as a
  `CategoryTheory.Limits.Cofan` on the disjoint union, which is the shape the colimit interface
  presents them in.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.comapAlgMap_sigma`: **the disjoint union's `ℂ`-algebra structure
  pulls back to each member's own**, which is what says the object is the disjoint union and not
  an unrelated space with the right carrier.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isCLinearHom_sigmaDesc`: **a descent map out of a coproduct of locally ringed
  spaces is `ℂ`-linear as soon as its restrictions are**, with no agreement-on-overlaps
  hypothesis. Nothing in it is analytic, so it is stated for a family of locally ringed spaces.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.sigmaι_sigmaDesc`: **the descent map restricts to the given
  morphism on each member**, which is the universal property in the form this file keeps.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_sigma`: **and a morphism out of a disjoint union is
  determined by those restrictions**, which is its uniqueness half. No agreement of the
  restrictions is asked for anywhere, in either direction.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isColimitCofanSigma`: **the two halves above, bundled — the
  disjoint union is the coproduct.** `## What is not here` used to say this bundle was absent and
  that nothing consumed one.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasCoproducts` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasFiniteCoproducts`: **the category of analytic spaces has
  coproducts of families indexed by any type of its own universe, and finite ones**, which is
  what lets `∐` and `⨿` be written for these objects. The second is
  `CategoryTheory.Limits.hasFiniteCoproducts_of_hasCoproducts` at the first and adds no
  mathematics; the finite index types it quantifies over live in `Type 0` and are reached by
  `CategoryTheory.Discrete.equivalence`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isEmpty_sigma`,
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isEmpty_sigma_of_members` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.not_surjective_sigmaι_base`: the non-vacuity statements, at
  either end — the disjoint union is empty when the index type is empty and when the members are,
  and an inclusion is not surjective when a second member has a point.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.not_isIso_sigmaι`: **so an inclusion is not an isomorphism**,
  under the same two hypotheses. **This is still not a statement that the disjoint union and the
  member are non-isomorphic** — that would be a statement about an invariant, and the caveat on
  the item above applies here word for word.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isIso_sigmaι`: **at a subsingleton index type it is one**, which
  is the case the hypotheses of the two items above exclude. Its inverse is a descent map, so
  nothing about the structure sheaves is computed on the way.

## Why the descent map needs a lemma at all

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom` carries an `IsCLinearHom` field, and the universal property of
the coproduct in `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace` does not supply it: it produces a morphism
of locally ringed spaces and nothing more. `ComplexAnalytic.IsCLinearHom.of_openCover` says
`ℂ`-linearity is local on the source and asks for **no** agreement of the pieces on the overlaps —
which is exactly why it applies here, where the map arrives from a universal property rather than
from `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.OpenCover.glueMorphisms` and so carries no such
hypothesis to hand over.

## One seam, and it is not the one it looks like

**Supply `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.comapAlgMap_ofOpenCover_algebraMap`'s cover argument
explicitly.** With every argument left as `_` the unifier works backwards from the goal into the
coproduct and does not come back: elaboration fails with a heartbeat timeout that survives
`maxHeartbeats 2000000`. Nothing about the statement is at fault — `#check` on it is instant.

**It is the cover and not the rest**, measured in both directions: naming the cover and leaving
the family, the compatibility and the local models as `_` elaborates in seconds, while naming
those three and leaving the cover as `_` still times out. The shape to recognise is therefore **a
projection of an earlier argument in a later argument's type** — the index `j` has type `𝒰.J`, so
a metavariable cover hands the unifier `?𝒰.J =?= ι`, which it cannot invert and so unfolds. That
rule is about the projection and not about coproducts, and it reaches past this lemma.

**The spelling of the round trip is not part of it**, which is worth saying because it looks as
though it should be. `(sigmaCover F).map j` and `Sigma.ι _ j` are equal by `rfl` and **not**
reducibly — `with_reducible rfl` fails on them — and yet the round trip below proves at either
spelling with the arguments named, and fails at either spelling with them left as `_`. The
statement uses `(sigmaCover F).map j` because that is the shape the cover-indexed consumers
(`ComplexAnalytic.IsCLinearHom.of_openCover` among them) present, not because the other spelling
costs anything.

## What is not here

**This section used to open by saying that no `CategoryTheory.Limits.IsColimit` was here, that the
two halves of the universal property were here as separate lemmas, and that what the bundle would
additionally buy was an interface nothing consumed. The bundle is here now and the reason it was
worth building is the last of those three.** `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isColimitCofanSigma`
is it, and **the mathematics is still the two lemmas**:
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.sigmaι_sigmaDesc` is existence and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_sigma` is uniqueness, and the bundle passes each of them to
one field of `CategoryTheory.Limits.Cofan.IsColimit.mk` and proves nothing of its own. What it
adds is the interface — the cofan, the two `Has…` instances, and `∐` and `⨿` becoming writable for
these objects.

**What asks for that interface is `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Galois/Basic.lean`'s definition of a
Galois category**, whose namespace is not in this repository's import closure and so cannot be
cited by name here. **What is here does not satisfy it.** That definition asks for finite
coproducts of the *category of finite étale covers of a fixed base*, which is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver`; the instances below are about
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`, and carrying a colimit from the one to the other is a statement
about that comma category which this file does not make. So the reading to avoid is that the
axiom is stated here: what is here is the ingredient it would be built from.

**That statement is made in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`**, as
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.hasFiniteCoproducts`, and its proof reads
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.sigmaι_sigmaDesc` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_sigma` rather than
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isColimitCofanSigma`: the descent map has to be re-wrapped as a
morphism over the base in any case, and once it is there is nothing left for the bundle to carry.
**So this file's own claim — that it does not make that statement — stays exact**, and what would
go stale is a reading of it as a claim that no file makes it.

**Nothing about `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFinite` or
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso`** for the inclusions or for `∐_{Fin n} X ⟶ X`, and no
count of sheets. All of it is `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SigmaFiniteEtale.lean`'s, which imports this
file — **and the reason is not the same for the two**. The descent map's needs the fibres of that
map, which is why it is stated where they are; the **inclusion**'s needs only that the members
are pairwise disjoint, which is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.not_surjective_sigmaι_base`'s own
input and is here, so `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_sigmaι` is over there for the
import edge to `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Finite.lean` alone: this file reaches neither of the two
classes. It is not that its proofs read nothing from here —
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_sigmaι`, one of the two rungs it is built from, rewrites
with `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.sigmaι_toLRSHom` twice.

**No claim that the disjoint union is not one of its members** beyond
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.not_surjective_sigmaι_base`, which is about the *inclusion* being
non-surjective on points at a two-member family with the other member inhabited. That an analytic
space is not *isomorphic* to another is a statement about an invariant and nothing here computes
one.

A `CategoryTheory.Limits.Cofan` is a cocone over a family, and this is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.sigma` with `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.sigmaι` in the two
slots. There is no content: the declaration exists because
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isColimitCofanSigma` has to name the cocone it is a colimit of, and
because that cocone is what `CategoryTheory.Limits.Cofan.inj` presents the inclusions as. -/

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.sigmaDesc` supplies the descent map,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.sigmaι_sigmaDesc` is the factorisation field and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_sigma` is the uniqueness field, each handed to
`CategoryTheory.Limits.Cofan.IsColimit.mk` as it stands.

**The uniqueness field is a term and not a `rw`, and the reason is the seam this file already
records.** `## One seam, and it is not the one it looks like` says that
`(sigmaCover F).map j` and `Sigma.ι _ j` are equal by `rfl` and **not** reducibly; the same holds
of `(cofanSigma F).inj i` and `sigmaι F i`, and it is what makes `rw [h i]` report the target as
not type-correct under the `instances` transparency level. Composing the hypothesis with

`Type u` because that is the universe `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.sigma` accepts an index type
from.

**Stating it for every index type is what makes it subsume

argued from the shapes. -/

/-! ### Non-vacuity, at the two ends -/

/-- **The disjoint union of the empty family is empty.**

The reading this closes is at the bottom end: a construction that returned some fixed space for
every family would satisfy everything above. Every point of a coproduct is in the image of some
member (`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.exists_sigma_ι_base_eq`) and there are no members,
so the carrier is empty. **Emptiness is a property of a space built some other way, and nothing in
the library is defined as the empty analytic space**: that is as true of the sibling below and of
`ComplexAnalytic.isEmpty_refineAnalytification` — the same statement for a refinement at an empty
index type — as it is of this one. `OkaTest/` instantiates this one, and
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalModel.lean` uses the phrase only to say that the node is *not* it.

The sentence this replaces said that this was *the only declaration in the library that names the
empty analytic space*. That was exact at `0b19eb1`, which wrote it, and **`9ce75e2` falsified it
six days later** by adding `ComplexAnalytic.isEmpty_refineAnalytification` and sweeping nothing
here; `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.surjective_base_or_isEmpty_of_isFiniteEtale` names the same
property of an arbitrary analytic space in its second branch. -/
theorem isEmpty_sigma [IsEmpty ι] : IsEmpty (sigma F) := by
  refine ⟨fun x ↦ ?_⟩
  obtain ⟨i, _, _⟩ := exists_sigma_ι_base_eq (fun i ↦ (F i).toLocallyRingedSpace) x
  exact IsEmpty.elim ‹IsEmpty ι› i

/-- **And so is the disjoint union of a family whose members are all empty**, which is the same
reading of the same lemma at the other quantifier.

`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.exists_sigma_ι_base_eq` again — every point of a coproduct
is in the image of some member — with the emptiness discharged at the point of the member rather
than at the index. It is the proof above with `y` in place of `i`.

**It implies the theorem above and does not replace it.** At an empty index type
`∀ i, IsEmpty (F i)` holds vacuously, so that statement follows from this one; what does not
follow is its *use*: instance search does not find the members' instance from `[IsEmpty ι]`, and
a caller would have to write the vacuous one out by hand. The hypothesis is
an instance rather than an explicit argument for the same reason the one above is: the callers
that want it have it that way, a trivial cover over an empty base being `fun _ ↦ X` at an empty
`X`. `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.hom_ext_of_isEmpty` takes the explicit form and its
docstring gives the reason, which is that the carrier of a `restrict` is not something instance
search finds; no `restrict` is involved here. -/
theorem isEmpty_sigma_of_members [∀ i, IsEmpty (F i : Type u)] : IsEmpty (sigma F) := by

  obtain ⟨i, y, _⟩ := exists_sigma_ι_base_eq (fun i ↦ (F i).toLocallyRingedSpace) x
  exact IsEmpty.elim (‹∀ i, IsEmpty (F i : Type u)› i) y

/-- **With a second member that has a point, an inclusion is not surjective**, so the disjoint
union is not the member in disguise.

The reading this closes is at the top end, and it needs both hypotheses: at a one-member family
the inclusion *is* surjective — `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isIso_sigmaι` below says it is an
isomorphism there — and at a family whose other members are empty it is surjective again.
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.eq_of_sigmaι_base_eq` is the whole proof — a point of the
`j`-th member cannot be in the image of the `i`-th.

Note what it is not: two analytic spaces with different carriers can still be isomorphic to a
third, and this says nothing about `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.sigma F` being non-isomorphic to
`F i`. That is a statement about an invariant and nothing here computes one. -/

  obtain ⟨x, hx⟩ := hs ((Sigma.ι (fun i ↦ (F i).toLocallyRingedSpace) j).base y)
  exact hij (eq_of_sigmaι_base_eq _ hx)

/-- **So under the same two hypotheses an inclusion is not an isomorphism.**

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.surjective_base_of_isIso` (`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Basic.lean`) against
the theorem above: an isomorphism is surjective on points and this inclusion is not. Both
hypotheses are still needed, for the reasons that theorem gives, and no import is added — that
lemma sits in a module this file already reaches.

**The caveat above is unchanged and this does not weaken it.** It says nothing about
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.sigma F` being non-isomorphic to `F i`: this refutes `IsIso` for
*this* morphism, and two spaces with different carriers can still be isomorphic by some other
one. The statement about an invariant is still the statement nothing here computes. -/
theorem not_isIso_sigmaι {i j : ι} (hij : i ≠ j) (y : (F j).toLocallyRingedSpace) :
    ¬ IsIso (sigmaι F i) := fun _ ↦
  not_surjective_sigmaι_base F hij y (surjective_base_of_isIso _)

/-- **At a one-member family the inclusion is an isomorphism**, which is the converse case the two
theorems above leave open and the reason both of their hypotheses are there.

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.not_isIso_sigmaι` needs a second index with an inhabited member;
this is what happens when there is no second index at all. `[Subsingleton ι]` and not `[Unique ι]`
is the honest hypothesis: `j` supplies the point that would make `ι` unique, and a caller who has
the index has it.

**The inverse is a descent map and there is no sheaf argument in it.** Each member is sent to
`F j` by the `eqToHom` of `Subsingleton.elim`, and the two round trips are
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.sigmaι_sigmaDesc` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_sigma`. So this is a corollary of the universal property
rather than a computation with the structure sheaves — worth saying because
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SigmaFiniteEtale.lean` recorded the fold map's case as absent and priced it as
*"a statement about the structure sheaves as well"*, and that price is not what it costs. -/
