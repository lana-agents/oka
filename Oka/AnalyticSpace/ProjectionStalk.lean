# Forgetting coordinates, on germs and stalks

An embedding `e : κ ↪ ι` of index types gives the map `ℂ^ι → ℂ^κ` forgetting the coordinates
outside its range, and that map is `ComplexAnalytic.okaMapHom` at the family of coordinate
functions `fun j ↦ coord (e j)`. This file computes what it does to a germ: **through
`okaStalkEquiv`, it is `LocalOkaRing.renameEmb e`**, the relabelling of the variables.

At `e = Fin.castSuccEmb` that is the projection `ℂ^(n+1) → ℂ^n` and the relabelling is
`LocalOkaRing.incl`, the inclusion of the power series that do not involve the last variable.
That identification is what a quotient statement about `LocalOkaRing` needs before it can be read
as a statement about a morphism of spaces. `LocalOkaRing.quotientDegreeOneEquiv` and
`LocalOkaRing.quotientSimpleZeroEquiv` (`Oka/Regular.lean`) are both built from
`LocalOkaRing.incl` followed by a quotient map, and without a lemma naming the geometric map that
`incl` comes from they identify the germ ring one dimension down with a quotient by an
*abstract* isomorphism rather than by the stalk map of the projection.

## The proof, in one sentence

The Taylor expansion of `s ∘ (· ∘ e)` at `z` is the Taylor expansion of `s` at `z ∘ e` with the
variables renamed. `MvPowerSeries.Represents.renameEmb` is that sentence about power series,
`OkaRing.germ_eq_of_represents` is what reduces a claim about a germ to a claim about what its
series represents, and `LocalOkaRing.coe_renameEmb` says the rename is `renameEmb`.

**Why the equality below is taken on a neighbourhood, which is a fact about the rewrite and not
about the claim.** `OkaRing.toGlobalFun` is total — it is `Function.extend Subtype.val _ 0` — so
off the preimage of `W` both sides are `0`, and `(w + z) ∘ e ∈ W` is the same condition on
either side. The identity therefore holds **globally**; what the neighbourhood buys is the
membership hypothesis that `OkaRing.toGlobalFun_apply` asks for. Dropping it is possible and
costs a `by_cases` and two `Function.extend_apply'` rewrites — four lines longer, and four lines
that say nothing about the geometry. **The obstacle is real and it is the rewrite**: with a
global `filter_upwards` both rewrites fail, on a hypothesis that says only `w ∈ Set.univ`.

## The two indexings, and why the last section is not an isomorphism of spaces

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` indexes the coordinates of `ℂ^n` by `ULift (Fin n)`, so that the
underlying type lives in an arbitrary universe; `Oka/Weierstrass.lean` and `LocalOkaRing.incl`
index them by `Fin n`. **What does not exist is a comparison of the two as spaces that survives
into an arbitrary universe**, and that is the only kind `AnalyticSpace` has a use for: the
`ULift` is carried for no other reason than to keep `complexAffineSpace` polymorphic, as
`Oka/ComplexSpace.lean` says where it is defined. For `u > 0` there is not even a type to write
down: `complexSpace (Fin n)` is a `LocallyRingedSpace.{0}` while the space underlying
`AnalyticSpace.complexAffineSpace.{u} n` is a `LocallyRingedSpace.{u}`, so the two are objects of
two different categories and the arrow between them does not elaborate.

**At `u = 0` it does, and morphisms exist in both directions**, out of this file's own API:
`ComplexAnalytic.coordEmb` at the embedding underlying `Equiv.ulift` and at the one underlying
`Equiv.ulift.symm`, each fed to `ComplexAnalytic.okaMapHom`, whose two underlying maps
`ComplexAnalytic.okaMapFun_coordEmb` makes mutually inverse in three lines. Nothing below uses
that, **because it does not generalise**: `ComplexAnalytic.okaMapHom`
(`Oka/AnalyticSpace/HolomorphicMap.lean`) binds its two index types to one universe, and
`ULift (Fin n)` shares a universe with `Fin n` at `u = 0` and nowhere else.
So a reader who goes looking for an isomorphism between the two spellings of `ℂ^n` should read
this as the answer — not that the question cannot be asked, but that the only place it can be
answered is `Type 0`, which is the one place `AnalyticSpace` was built not to be confined to.

What can be compared in every universe is the germ rings, which are rings and not spaces:
`LocalOkaRing.uliftEquiv` relabels `ULift ι` as `ι`, and `LocalOkaRing.uliftEquiv_renameEmb_incl`
says the relabelling turns the `ULift`ed `Fin.castSucc` into `incl`. The last section below is
that bridge crossed once.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.coordEmb`: the coordinates of `ℂ^ι` indexed by an embedded `κ`, whose
  `ComplexAnalytic.okaMapHom` is the map forgetting the rest, and `ComplexAnalytic.projCoords`,
  its instance at `Fin.castSuccEmb`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.uliftCastSuccEmb`: `Fin.castSucc` relabelled through `ULift`, and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.proj`, the projection `ℂ^(n+1) ⟶ ℂ^n` of complex analytic
  spaces it gives.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.okaMapFun_coordEmb`: the underlying map of the projection along `e` is
  `(· ∘ e)`, and `ComplexAnalytic.okaMapFun_projCoords`, its instance at `Fin.castSuccEmb`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.germ_okaMapC_coordEmb`: the germ of a pullback at `z` is the germ at `z ∘ e`
  with the variables relabelled, and `ComplexAnalytic.germ_okaMapC_projCoords`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.okaStalkEquiv_stalkMap_okaMapHom_coordEmb`: **the stalk map of the projection
  is that relabelling**, transported along the Taylor-expansion isomorphism, and
  `ComplexAnalytic.okaStalkEquiv_stalkMap_okaMapHom_projCoords`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.okaStalkEquiv_stalkMap_uliftProj`: **the stalk map of the
  projection `ℂ^(n+1) ⟶ ℂ^n` of complex analytic spaces is the inclusion of the Weierstrass
  theorems**, after both germ rings are relabelled from `ULift (Fin _)` to `Fin _`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.okaStalkEquiv_stalkMap_okaMapHom_projCoords_apply` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.okaStalkEquiv_stalkMap_uliftProj_apply`: the last two at an
  arbitrary element of the stalk rather than at a germ.

## What is not here

**Neither `LocalOkaRing.incl` nor `LocalOkaRing.renameEmb` nor `okaStalkEquiv` is named in the
list above**, though all three are what the results are stated in terms of and all three are
named in the paragraphs before it. That is deliberate: `scripts/guard_coverage.py` reads a
backticked name under a `## Main results` heading as a result the file advertises, and none of
them is a result of this file.

**No `IsIso`.** Assembling this with `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy`'s `surjective_stalkMap` and
`ker_stalkMap` into an isomorphism of stalks for a hypersurface with a simple zero is
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimpleZeroStalk.lean` and not here; what that file needs from this one is the
two `…_apply` results, and nothing else in it mentions a projection. The other statement of that
shape in the repository is `ComplexAnalytic.isIso_stalkMap_okaMapHom`
(`Oka/AnalyticSpace/StalkLocalInverse.lean`), whose hypothesis is an analytic local inverse
rather than a cut-out.

**No general substitution.** The Taylor series of `s ∘ okaMapFun u` for an arbitrary family `u`
is a composition of power series, which this repository does not have. Forgetting coordinates is
exactly the case where the operation already exists under another name,
`LocalOkaRing.renameEmb`.

**No section of the projection.** A germ in `ι` variables does not restrict to one in `κ`
variables without choosing values for the coordinates outside the range of `e`, which is again a
substitution; `Oka/RenameIndex.lean` records the same absence one level down.
