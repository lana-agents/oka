# Finite morphisms of complex analytic spaces

A holomorphic map is **finite** when it is closed and has finite fibres. That is the classical
definition — Grauert–Remmert take it, and so does Fischer — and it is what this file gives to
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom`, together with the stability properties that make it usable
and the two implications that make it non-vacuous.

## Why this definition and not the algebraic-geometry one

`AlgebraicGeometry.IsFinite` for schemes is `IsAffineHom f` together with `RingHom.Finite` on the
sections over every affine open, and its whole API — `HasAffineProperty`, `affineAnd`, stability
under composition and base change — is derived from affine-locality. **There are no affines in the
analytic category**, and the reason is that the machinery affine-locality is built out of does not
exist here: there is no `Spec`–`Γ` adjunction for analytic spaces, so no class of objects on which
a morphism's behaviour determines it globally, and no `HasAffineProperty` to state a property
against. `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` is defined by local models, and a local model is a closed
subspace of an open subset of `ℂ^n` — a chart, not an affine. So none of that transfers and there
is no `IsAffineHom` to extend.

The two conditions are also not the same notion, so this is not a choice between spellings of one
thing. For schemes, `Spec` of an infinite algebraic field extension `k ⟶ K` is a homeomorphism
between one-point spaces, hence closed with finite fibres, while `k ⟶ K` is not module-finite; so
`AlgebraicGeometry.IsFinite` fails there and the condition below holds. **That example is not
formalised here** and nothing in this file depends on it; it is recorded because it is the reason
the class is stated in the `ComplexAnalytic` namespace rather than for
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace` in the mirror tree, where its name would read as the
scheme-theoretic condition and would specialise to a different one.

## Properness, and exactly what agrees with what

A finite morphism is proper: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isProperMap_base_of_isFinite`. That
is a theorem rather than part of the definition, and it needs **no separation hypothesis** — a
finite set is compact in any topological space, unlike the covering-map statement in
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/CoveringMap.lean`, which does need one on the source.

**The converse is false, and this file used to say "proper and finite-with-finite-fibres agree"
in a way that invited the false reading.** Properness gives *compact* fibres, and a compact fibre
is finite only when it is also discrete, so properness alone does not imply finiteness. What is
true is the agreement with finiteness of the fibres carried on **both** sides: `IsFinite f` iff
the underlying map is proper and has finite fibres, which is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_iff_isProperMap_base_and_finite_fiber`. Read that way the
content of the agreement is exactly `IsProperMap ↔ IsClosedMap` **given** finite fibres, which is
where the two directions sit: one is `IsProperMap.isClosedMap`, the other is the compactness of a
finite set.

There is deliberately no `IsProper` class. `IsProperMap` on `f.toLRSHom.base` already is the
statement; a class would have to carry its own identity, composition and non-vacuity API to earn
its place, and nothing here or downstream consumes one.

## Cancellation, and which hypothesis each half needs

The two fields cancel differently, and saying which is which is what keeps the finite étale rung's
gap legible. **The fibre half cancels outright**:
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.finite_fiber_of_comp` deduces finite fibres for `f` from finite
fibres for `f ≫ g`, and asks nothing whatever of `g` — not finiteness, not closedness, not
injectivity — because the fibre of `f` over `y` sits inside the fibre of `f ≫ g` over `g y`.

**The closed half does not, and it does not even given that `g` is finite.** Take the real line
with two origins over the real line, with `f` the inclusion of one of the two branches: then
`f ≫ g` is the identity, hence closed with finite fibres, and `g` is closed with fibres of at most
two points, while the complement of the image of `f` is the other origin alone, which is not open
— so `f` is not closed. **That is a statement about topological spaces, and one of that shape is
now compiled**: `TwoIndiscrete.not_isClosedMap_pt_of_isClosedMap_comp`
(`OkaTest/FiniteEtaleCancel.lean`) exhibits a `g` that is continuous, closed and has finite
fibres, an `f` that is continuous, a
closed `f ≫ g` and a non-closed `f`. It is a two-point indiscrete space and not the line with two
origins, so it is the weaker witness in one respect — its `g` is not a local homeomorphism — and
the line with two origins is still compiled nowhere.

That paragraph does not collide with `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_isFinite_comp`,
which is this file's older cancellation lemma and asks the second factor to be injective: the `g`
above is exactly not that, at the two origins.

**What the two witnesses have in common is not their second factor, and that is what the closed
half actually needs.** In both, the middle space carries two topologically indistinguishable
points — the two origins, and the two points of the indiscrete pair — and that is the whole of
what keeps the image of `f` from being closed. **A separation axiom on the middle space, and
nothing about `g`, is therefore the hypothesis**:
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_comp_of_t2Space` asks `[T2Space Y]` and asks of `g`
exactly what the fibre half asks, which is nothing. **So both halves cancel**, and the whole cost
of the pair is one separation axiom on `Y`.

**The classical repair is not needed, and this file used to imply that it was the only route.**
Factoring `f` through its graph and asking `Y` to be separated over the base needs a separatedness
notion and fibre products, and neither exists here — that absence is real and is recorded in the
base-change paragraph below. It is not what was obstructing this: `isProperMap_of_comp_of_t2` is
Mathlib's cancellation for proper maps at `[T2Space Y]` and asks nothing of the second factor
beyond continuity, and a finite morphism is proper
(`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isProperMap_base_of_isFinite`), so the closed half is those two
lemmas and no new topology at all. **`[T2Space Y]` is a genuine hypothesis and not an instance
that will be found** — `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Basic.lean` imposes no separation axiom, as
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme` does not — and the counterexample above is exactly the witness that it
cannot be dropped.

## What is not here, and it is the whole of the subject

**Grauert's finite mapping theorem** — that `f_*𝒪_X` is a coherent `𝒪_Y`-module for finite `f` —
is what makes this definition useful, and it is not proved here or anywhere in this repository.
Nothing below mentions a pushforward. That absence stands; the properness clause that used to
stand beside it does not, and is now the section above.

**Finite covers are a further condition and are not defined here.** The Riemann existence theorem
is about finite *étale* covers — finite together with being a local isomorphism — and that is a
second notion resting on this one.

**There is no base change.** `AlgebraicGeometry.IsFinite`'s `IsStableUnderBaseChange` has no
analogue below because this repository has no fibre products of analytic spaces; the absence is
stated here rather than left to be discovered.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFinite`: **a morphism of complex analytic spaces is finite when
  its underlying map is closed and has finite fibres.**

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_id` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_comp`: the finite morphisms contain the identities and
  are closed under composition.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_isIso`: an isomorphism is finite.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_isClosedEmbedding` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_isCutOutBy`: **a closed embedding is finite, and
  hence so is every morphism cutting its source out of its target by global sections** — which is
  every local model this development builds.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_comp_of_isClosedEmbedding`: **a closed embedding
  followed by a map that is closed and has finite fibres *over the image of that embedding* is
  finite**, even when the second factor is not.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_isFinite_comp`: **finiteness cancels along an
  injective second factor** — if `f ≫ i` is finite and the underlying map of `i` is injective,
  then `f` is finite. This is what carries a finiteness statement proved over an ambient `ℂ^n`
  back to one over a closed analytic subspace of it, which is the shape the standard-étale line
  needs: `Oka/Analytification/MonicHypersurface.lean` proves the projection of a hypersurface to
  `ℂ^n` finite, and `Oka/Analytification/HypersurfaceFinite.lean` cancels
  `ComplexAnalytic.isClosedEmbedding_base_analytificationIncl` against it to get finiteness over
  the analytification of the base algebra — `A ⟶ A[X] ⧸ (F)` for `F` monic, which is this
  theorem's first consumer that is not about `ℂ^n`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.finite_fiber_of_comp`: **the fibre half of finiteness cancels
  with no hypothesis at all** — if `f ≫ g` has finite fibres then so does `f`, and the second
  factor is not asked to be finite, closed or injective.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_comp_of_t2Space`: **the closed half cancels too, and
  the only thing it costs is a separation axiom on the middle space** — if `f ≫ g` is finite and
  the target of `f` is Hausdorff then `f` is finite, with nothing asked of the second factor
  either. See the cancellation section above for the counterexample that says the separation
  axiom cannot be dropped.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.not_isFinite_of_infinite_fiber`: the criterion a non-example is
  exhibited by.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isProperMap_base_of_isFinite`: **a finite morphism is proper**,
  and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_iff_isProperMap_base_and_finite_fiber` is the
  agreement in both directions.

/-- **A morphism cutting its source out of its target by global sections is finite.**

`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy` carries `isClosedEmbedding` as a field, so this is that field read
through `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_isClosedEmbedding`. It is the statement that
makes the class non-vacuous in general rather than at one example: every closed analytic subspace
this development cuts out — every local model, in particular — is finite over its ambient space.

Like `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.mono_of_isCutOutBy`, this takes the cut-out data as a
hypothesis about `f.toLRSHom` rather than producing it, because most analytic-level morphisms
carrying such data are built by the caller; see `OkaTest/FiniteMorphism.lean` for a closed
embedding exhibited directly instead. **One class of them is not**: an analytification carries
its own datum, `ComplexAnalytic.isCutOutBy_analytificationInclHom`, and a caller holding one of
those has this theorem for free. -/

  isFinite_of_isClosedEmbedding f h.isClosedEmbedding

/-- **A closed embedding followed by a map that is closed and has finite fibres over the image of
that embedding is finite.**

This is the shape every finite morphism onto a *non-closed* image in this development has, and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_comp` does not cover it: there `p` itself has to be
finite, and the projection `ℂ^(n+1) ⟶ ℂ^n` is not — `ComplexAnalytic.not_isFinite_proj` in
`OkaTest/FiniteMorphism.lean` is that non-example. What is asked here instead is that `p` be
closed and finite-fibred **only along `Set.range i.base`**, which for a hypersurface is a
statement about the roots of one family of polynomials and is exactly what
`Polynomial.isClosed_fst_image_of_monic` and `Polynomial.finite_inter_fst_preimage_of_monic`
supply. `Oka/AnalyticSpace/MonicProjection.lean` is the consumer.

Both hypotheses are stated for **sets** rather than for the restriction of `p` to a subtype. The
closedness one is then literally what `IsClosedMap` gives after the embedding has been applied,
so no subtype topology has to be reconciled with anything, and the fibre one is a `Set.Finite`
rather than a `Finite` instance for the same reason.

Nothing is asked of `i` beyond its underlying map being a closed embedding; in particular this
does not go through `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy`, which is how it applies to a morphism built by
hand. -/

/-- **The fibre half of finiteness cancels, with no hypothesis at all**: if `f ≫ g` has finite
fibres then so does `f`, whatever `g` is.

The fibre of `f` over `y` is contained in the fibre of `f ≫ g` over `g y`, and a subset of a finite
set is finite. **There is no hypothesis on `g` at all** — no `[IsFinite g]`, no injectivity — and
`g` is in the binders only because the composite mentions it.

**This is one of the two halves of a cancellation statement for
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFinite`, and it is the half that needs no hypothesis at all**; the
other is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_comp_of_t2Space` at the foot of this file,
which asks nothing of `g` either and one separation axiom of `Y`.
It is also the fibre half of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_isFinite_comp` below, which is where this containment
used to be written out inline: that lemma's injectivity hypothesis is consumed entirely in its
closed half, and factoring this out is what makes that visible in the statements rather than only
in the prose.

**A `theorem` and not an `instance`**, for the reason
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_of_comp` gives in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalIso.lean`:

/-- **Finiteness cancels along an injective second factor**: if `f ≫ i` is finite and the
underlying map of `i` is injective, then `f` is finite.

**Do not read this as a converse of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_comp_of_isClosedEmbedding`**, whose name is one word away
and whose statement is the other direction — that one *builds* a finite composite out of a closed
embedding and a map well behaved along its image, while this one takes a finite composite apart.
Nor of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_comp`, which needs both factors finite; here the
second factor need not be finite at all, only injective.

**Injectivity is asked for and nothing more, and the proof below consumes it in exactly one of
the two fields.** The fibre half is free, and it is now a theorem of its own that says so:
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.finite_fiber_of_comp`, directly above, asks nothing at all of the
second factor. Injectivity would upgrade its containment to an equality; staying with the
containment is what keeps the one place the hypothesis is used visible. The closed half is that
place, and it uses the continuity of `i` rather than any closedness of it: for `C` closed,
`f.toLRSHom.base '' C` is the **preimage** under `i.toLRSHom.base` of
`(f ≫ i).toLRSHom.base '' C`, which is closed by hypothesis. So `IsClosedEmbedding` would be the
wrong hypothesis — it asks for closedness that is never consumed — and this file's style is to ask
for no more than is used, as
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_isClosedEmbedding`'s docstring says of the structure
sheaves.

**Injectivity can be dropped if `Y` is Hausdorff, and the shape any counterexample must have
says why.** Since the fibre half consumes nothing, a `f` that is not finite while `f ≫ i` is must
have finite fibres and a base map that is not closed; so the `i` beside it has to identify a limit
point of some image `f.toLRSHom.base '' C` with a point of that image — which is a point of `Y`
not separated from that image, and is impossible in a Hausdorff space.
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_comp_of_t2Space` at the foot of this file is that
statement, and the two are incomparable rather than one subsuming the other: this one holds for a
non-Hausdorff `Y` and that one for a non-injective `i`. -/

/-- **A finite morphism is proper**, in the sense that its underlying map is an `IsProperMap`.

`isProperMap_iff_isClosedMap_and_compact_fibers` asks for three things and the class supplies two
of them directly; the third, continuity, is not a field of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFinite` and does not need to be, since the underlying map is a
`TopCat` morphism and carries its continuity with it.

**No separation hypothesis is used and none is available.** A finite set is compact in an
arbitrary topological space (`Set.Finite.isCompact`), so compactness of the fibres falls out of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFinite.finite_fiber` alone. That is not true of the covering-map
statement in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/CoveringMap.lean`, which genuinely needs `[T2Space X]`; the
hypothesis should not be carried over here out of symmetry with it.

**The converse fails**: properness gives compact fibres, not finite ones. See
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_iff_isProperMap_base_and_finite_fiber` for the agreement
that does hold, and the module docstring for why the weaker-sounding statement is the honest
one. -/

/-- **A morphism is finite exactly when its underlying map is proper and has finite fibres.**

This is the agreement the module docstring is careful about: finiteness of the fibres appears on
*both* sides, because properness does not imply it. With it assumed, the whole content is that a
proper map is closed (`IsProperMap.isClosedMap`) and that a closed map with finite — hence
compact — fibres is proper.

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_iff`, generated by `@[mk_iff]` on the class, is the
same statement with `IsClosedMap` in place of `IsProperMap`. -/

    fun h ↦ ⟨h.1.isClosedMap, h.2⟩⟩

/-- **Finiteness cancels along a second factor whose source is Hausdorff**: if `f ≫ g` is finite
and `Y` is Hausdorff, then `f` is finite. **Nothing is asked of `g`** — not finiteness, not
closedness, not injectivity, not that it be a local isomorphism — exactly as in
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.finite_fiber_of_comp`, of which this is the other half.

Both fields are one lemma. The fibre half *is* `finite_fiber_of_comp`. The closed half is
`isProperMap_of_comp_of_t2` — Mathlib's cancellation for proper maps, whose `[T2Space]` is on the
**middle** space, which is `Y` here — applied to
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isProperMap_base_of_isFinite`, and then `IsProperMap.isClosedMap`.
The `rfl` identifying the underlying map of `f ≫ g` with the composite of the two underlying maps
is the one `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_comp` uses; it is stated rather than left to
unification because the `▸` below needs it in that direction.

**`[T2Space Y]` is a hypothesis and not an instance that will be found.**
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Basic.lean` imposes no separation axiom on an analytic space, for the reason
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme` does not; the only `T2Space` instance for one in this repository is
`ComplexAnalytic.t2Space_restrict_punctured`, about a single restriction of a single space. And it
cannot be dropped: `TwoIndiscrete.not_isClosedMap_pt_of_isClosedMap_comp`
(`OkaTest/FiniteEtaleCancel.lean`) is a compiled witness with a two-point indiscrete middle space,
whose second factor is closed with finite fibres — so no strengthening of `g` short of one that
forces `Y` to be Hausdorff can replace it.

**It is on the *middle* space and not on the source or the target**, which is where the module
docstring's counterexamples put the failure and is the position `isProperMap_of_comp_of_t2` asks
for. `X` and `Z` are unconstrained.

**A `theorem` and not an `instance`**, for the reason
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.finite_fiber_of_comp` gives: instance search would have to invent
`Z` and `g`, which the goal determines in no way.

Placed here rather than beside `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.finite_fiber_of_comp`, where it
belongs thematically, only because it consumes
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isProperMap_base_of_isFinite` and that is declared above. -/
