# The binary product of two local models

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/AffineProductOpen.lean` makes `ℂ^(n+m)|affineProdOpens V W` the binary product
of `ℂ^n|V` and `ℂ^m|W`. That is the *ambient* object of a product of two local models, and this
file cuts the product out inside it: if `X` is cut out in `ℂ^n|V` by `f₁, …, f_k` and `Y` is cut
out in `ℂ^m|W` by `g₁, …, g_l`, then **the zero locus, inside `ℂ^(n+m)|affineProdOpens V W`, of
the `f j` pulled back along the first leg together with the `g j` pulled back along the second is
the binary product of `X` and `Y`.**

## The object costs no stalk-level work

`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isCutOutBy_zeroLocusSubspaceι` in
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalModel.lean` gives all four fields of `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy` — closed
embedding, image, surjectivity on stalks, kernel — for an arbitrary locally ringed space and an
arbitrary finite family of global sections, and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOut` turns that datum into an analytic space carrying the
right `ℂ`-algebra structure. So the candidate product object is assembled and not constructed, and
nothing below computes a stalk. What has content is the universal property, and the universal
property is `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.lift` in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Factorisation.lean` used three
times: twice to build the projections and once to build the pair.

## The mapping property in the shape this file uses it

`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.lift` and `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.existsUnique_liftHom` take a
morphism of *locally ringed spaces* into the ambient open subspace, together with a `ℂ`-linearity
hypothesis and the vanishing of the cutting sections. Everything this file pairs and cancels is a
morphism of *analytic spaces*, so that mapping property is repackaged at the analytic level
before the product is built: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOutHom` is the closed immersion
as a morphism of analytic spaces, `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftHom` is the factorisation,
and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_ofCutOut` is uniqueness. **No transport is involved**:
the `ℂ`-algebra structure `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOut` installs is by definition the
ambient one pulled back along the immersion, so the `ℂ`-linearity of `ofCutOutHom` is `fun _ ↦ rfl`
and the one of `liftHom` is `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.isCLinearHom_lift` at the nose.

Those three are stated for an arbitrary closed immersion into an arbitrary `ℂ^n|V` and do not
mention the product. It is here rather than earlier because it needs both
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOut`, which arrives in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalModel.lean`,
and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrict`, which arrives in
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenSubspace.lean` — and `Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenSubspace.lean` imports
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalModel.lean`, so neither of those two files has both.
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Factorisation.lean` does not have `restrict` either. A reader who would rather
see it in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenSubspace.lean` is making a reasonable call; the reason it is not
there is that that file's subject is the open subspace and this is the mapping property of a
closed one.

## The vanishing condition, which is the step this file was expected to fight

`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.lift` asks that the morphism being factored kill the cutting sections
*as a map on global sections*, and what comes free from the zero-locus datum is the vanishing of
the *pulled-back* sections. Turning one into the other is contravariant functoriality of global
sections along a composite, which is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom.pullbackΓ_comp` in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Basic.lean` — added there
by this branch, beside the `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom.pullbackΓ` it is about. With that
lemma each of the three vanishing obligations is two rewrites and a `map_zero`; without it the
`Γ.map` spelling puts the goal outside the `instances` transparency level and every later rewrite
is rejected, which is the seam
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom.pullbackΓ`'s own docstring records.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOutHom`: the closed immersion of
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOut` as a morphism of analytic spaces.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftHom`: the factorisation of a morphism of analytic spaces
  killing the cutting sections.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutFamily`: the `k + l` sections that cut the product out.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOut`: the product object.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutι`: its closed immersion into
  `ℂ^(n+m)|affineProdOpens V W`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutFst` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutSnd`: the two projections.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutLift`: the pair.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutIsoProd`: the identification of
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOut` with the categorical product `X ⨯ Y`.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_ofCutOut`: **a morphism into
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOut` is determined by its composite with the immersion**,
  which is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.mono_of_isCutOutBy` in cancellation form.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCutOutBy_prodCutFamily`: **the product object is cut out by
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutFamily`**, with no proof obligation of its own.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutLift_fst`,
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutLift_snd` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_prodCutOut`: the two triangles and uniqueness.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLimitBinaryFanProdCutOut`: **the zero locus of the appended
  family is the binary product of the two local models**, and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasBinaryProduct_ofCutOut` is the instance.

## What is not here

* **`CategoryTheory.Limits.HasBinaryProducts ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`.** What lands here is
  the product of two objects presented as `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOut` — that is, of
  two *local models* — and nothing wider. A general analytic space is only locally a local model,
  and gluing the local products is a separate rung. At `bbbc91f`, which is this file's base, with
  this file added to the tree, `#synth CategoryTheory.Limits.HasBinaryProducts
  ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` fails — elaborated rather than grepped.
* **Anything over a base.** Both statements here are absolute products. The fibre product over a
  common base is an equaliser inside such a product; no construction below builds an equaliser or
  bears on `CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPullback`, and `#synth
  CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPullbacks ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` fails at the same head.
* **Any description of the product on points.** The underlying set of
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOut` is the zero locus of the appended family, and no
  statement below identifies it with a set of pairs or computes the base map of either projection.
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.base_affineProdFst` and its companions in
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/AffineProductOpen.lean` are what such a statement would run on.
* **Independence of the presentation.** `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOut` is indexed by
  the two cutting families and not by the two spaces, and two presentations of the same local
  model give two objects, canonically isomorphic through
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutIsoProd` at each and the universal property. Nothing
  below states that isomorphism.

/-- **The binary product of two local models exists**, so `X ⨯ Y` is usable notation at a pair of
them.

`CategoryTheory.Limits.HasBinaryProduct` is `Prop`-valued, so this instance loses the
identification of the product with the zero locus;
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLimitBinaryFanProdCutOut` is what keeps it, and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutIsoProd` is that identification stated against the
notation. -/

/-- **The zero locus of the appended family is the categorical product**, as an isomorphism
against the `⨯` notation.

Two limits with the same diagram, so
`CategoryTheory.Limits.IsLimit.conePointUniqueUpToIso`. **The statement does not elaborate unless
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasBinaryProduct_ofCutOut` is found by instance search**, `⨯` being
notation for a `CategoryTheory.Limits.limit` that needs it; so this declaration, and the guard on
it, test that the instance is found and not merely that it exists. -/
