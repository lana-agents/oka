# The local rings of a complex analytic space are Noetherian

The stalks of the structure sheaf of a complex analytic space are Noetherian local rings. This
is the standing hypothesis behind local analytic geometry, and the companion statement to
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoherentStructureSheaf` of `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Coherent.lean`.

The deduction is short, because the two inputs are already available. On `ℂ^ι` the stalk at a
point is the ring of convergent power series at the origin (`okaStalkEquiv` of
`Oka/StalkEquiv.lean`), which is Noetherian by the Rückert basis theorem
(`LocalOkaRing.instIsNoetherianRing` of `Oka/Noetherian.lean`). Restricting to an open subset
does not change the stalks, and a local model has, by definition, surjective stalk maps from an
open subset of some `ℂ^n`, so its stalks are quotients of Noetherian rings. An analytic space is
locally a local model, and again restricting to an open subset does not change the stalks.

## Main results

- `isNoetherianRing_okaStalk` and `isNoetherianRing_stalk_complexSpace`: the stalks of
  `𝒪_{ℂ^ι}` are Noetherian.
- `ComplexAnalytic.IsLocalModel.isNoetherianRing_stalk`: the stalks of a local model are
  Noetherian.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.instIsNoetherianRingStalk`: the stalks of a complex analytic
  space are Noetherian; with `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isLocalRing` they are
  therefore Noetherian local rings.

This restates `isNoetherianRing_okaStalk` for `complexSpace ι`. Both forms are needed as
instances: `(complexSpace ι).presheaf` is definitionally `okaCommPresheaf ι`, but instance
search does not unfold the definition of `complexSpace`. -/

/-- **The local rings of a complex analytic space are Noetherian.**

Every point has a neighbourhood which is a local model, whose stalks are Noetherian, and
restricting to an open subspace does not change the stalk. Together with the local ring
structure carried by any `LocallyRingedSpace` this says that the local rings of a complex
analytic space are Noetherian local rings. As with coherence, the `ℂ`-algebra structure plays
no role: this is a statement about the underlying locally ringed space. -/
