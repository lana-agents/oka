# A monomorphism of covers is injective on points, and the direct summand it cuts out

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/DirectSummand.lean` proves that a morphism of covers which is **injective on
points** exhibits its source as a direct summand of its target, and its `## What is not here`
named the missing half in terms until the push that added this file: *"A proof that a monomorphism
of covers is injective on points. That is the remaining obligation, and it is a theorem rather
than a formality — the classical argument makes the diagonal `A ⟶ A ×_B A` an isomorphism and
needs the fibre product."* That bullet now records the repair and keeps the retired wording as a
dated record. **The fibre product arrived in
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleBaseChange.lean`** — the base change of a finite étale morphism
along an arbitrary one — and this file spends it on that obligation.

## The argument, and it is shorter than the classical one

`A ×_B A` is the base change of `i` along itself. The two projections `p₁` and `p₂` satisfy
`p₁ ≫ i = p₂ ≫ i` because the square commutes, so a monomorphism `i` forces `p₁ = p₂`. **That is
already the whole of it**, because the carrier of the fibre product is
`Function.Pullback i.base i.base` on the nose: a pair of points of `A` with the same image, whose
two projections are its two components. Two points with the same image give a point of the fibre
product at which `p₁` reads off the first and `p₂` the second, so they are equal.

**The diagonal is never built and no isomorphism is proved.** The classical route makes
`A ⟶ A ×_B A` an isomorphism and reads injectivity off that; what injectivity actually needs is
one equation between two morphisms, evaluated at one point.

## Where each hypothesis is spent

* **`[T2Space A.left]`, the source cover's total space**, is spent once, in
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChange`: the fibre product of `i` with itself is a base
  change *along* `i`, so it is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoveringMap_baseChangeSndBase`
  that asks for it, and that lemma is where `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleBaseChange.lean` says
  its own `[T2Space E]` goes.
* **`[T2Space B.left]`, the target cover's total space**, is spent once, in
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.isFiniteEtale_left`, which is the cancellation
  that makes the underlying morphism of a morphism of covers finite étale.
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Finite.lean` records why that separation axiom is not an artefact of its
  proof.
* **Nothing is assumed of the base `X`** — not Hausdorff, not connected, not non-empty — and
  nothing is assumed of `i` beyond `Mono`.

**Neither hypothesis is derived from the other here, and neither is derived from a hypothesis on
the base.** A cover of a Hausdorff space has Hausdorff total space; that is a topological
statement, and this repository's `T2Space` instances for analytic spaces are the seven of
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Hausdorff.lean` — `ℂ^ι` and `ℂ^n`, an open subspace of `ℂ^n` and an open
subspace of an arbitrary Hausdorff analytic space, a zero locus in each of the two spellings, and
the node — none of which concludes anything about the total space of a cover.
So both hypotheses are asked for, and `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Hausdorff.lean` is where a later seat
would put the instance that removes one.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.selfProd`: **the fibre product `A ×_B A` as an
  object of the category of covers of `X`**, structured over `X` through its *second* projection.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.selfProdFst` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.selfProdSnd`: its two projections, as morphisms
  of covers.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.injective_base_of_baseChangeFst_eq`: **the two projections
  agreeing is what injectivity is**, for a finite étale morphism of analytic spaces with Hausdorff
  source. This is the step that reads points off the carrier and the only one that does.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.injective_base_of_mono`: **a monomorphism of complex analytic
  spaces which is finite étale with Hausdorff source is injective on points.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.injective_base_left_of_mono`: **a monomorphism of
  covers is injective on points**, when both total spaces are Hausdorff.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.inducesIsoOnDirectSummand_of_mono`: **a
  monomorphism of covers exhibits its source as a direct summand of its target**, which is
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/DirectSummand.lean`'s statement with its injectivity hypothesis discharged.

## What is not here

* **This is still not the `monoInducesIsoOnDirectSummand` field of
  `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Galois/Basic.lean`'s `PreGaloisCategory`.** That field asks for the
  summand at every monomorphism and under **no** hypothesis whatever; the last result below asks
  for `[T2Space A.left]` and `[T2Space B.left]`. What this file removes from the gap is the
  injectivity hypothesis and nothing else, and the two separation hypotheses are what is left.
* **No `PreGaloisCategory` instance**, and nothing here bears on the other fields: base change
  over a general cospan of morphisms *of covers*, quotients by finite group actions, and the
  preservation of epimorphisms by a fibre functor are each untouched.
* **Nothing about Hausdorffness.** That a cover of a Hausdorff analytic space has Hausdorff total
  space is a topological statement this repository does not make, and deriving either hypothesis
  below from a hypothesis on `X` would need it.
* **No diagonal and no isomorphism `A ≅ A ×_B A`.** The classical argument's object is not built,
  so nothing below says the fibre product of a monomorphism with itself is its source.
* **Nothing about a general mono of analytic spaces.**
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.injective_base_of_mono` asks its morphism to be finite étale with
  Hausdorff source, because that is what makes the base change exist; a monomorphism of analytic
  spaces with neither is not reached.

The carrier of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChange` is `Function.Pullback` of the two base

its two components — `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.base_baseChangeFst` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.base_baseChangeSnd` say so and the two `rfl`s below are the
subtype and product projections. **The hypothesis is an equation between morphisms and the

Its triangle over `X` is not `rfl` and is the one place the square is used at the level of

and the two composites to `B.left` agree by
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChange_square`. **The two `rfl`s after the rewrites are the

`change` and not a `show`**, for the reason `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.mono_ofRestrict`'s
docstring gives: the two spellings are `rfl`-equal and not syntactically equal, so
