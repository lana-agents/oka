# A monomorphism of covers is injective on points, and the direct summand it cuts out

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/DirectSummand.lean` proves that a morphism of covers which is **injective on
points** exhibits its source as a direct summand of its target, and its `## What is not here`
named the missing half in terms until the push that added this file: *"A proof that a monomorphism
of covers is injective on points. That is the remaining obligation, and it is a theorem rather
than a formality — the classical argument makes the diagonal `A ⟶ A ×_B A` an isomorphism and
needs the fibre product."* That bullet now records the repair and keeps the retired wording as a
dated record. **The fibre product arrived in
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleBaseChange.lean`** — the base change of a finite étale morphism
along an arbitrary one — and this file spends it on that obligation.

## The argument, and it is shorter than the classical one

`A ×_B A` is the base change of `i` along itself. The two projections `p₁` and `p₂` satisfy
`p₁ ≫ i = p₂ ≫ i` because the square commutes, so a monomorphism `i` forces `p₁ = p₂`. **That is
already the whole of it**, because the carrier of the fibre product is
`Function.Pullback i.base i.base` on the nose: a pair of points of `A` with the same image, whose
two projections are its two components. Two points with the same image give a point of the fibre
product at which `p₁` reads off the first and `p₂` the second, so they are equal.

**The diagonal is never built and no isomorphism is proved.** The classical route makes
`A ⟶ A ×_B A` an isomorphism and reads injectivity off that; what injectivity actually needs is
one equation between two morphisms, evaluated at one point.

## Where each hypothesis is spent

* **`[T2Space A.left]`, the source cover's total space**, is spent once, in
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChange`: the fibre product of `i` with itself is a base
  change *along* `i`, so it is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoveringMap_baseChangeSndBase`
  that asks for it, and that lemma is where `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleBaseChange.lean` says
  its own `[T2Space E]` goes.
* **`[T2Space B.left]`, the target cover's total space**, is spent once, in
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.isFiniteEtale_left`, which is the cancellation
  that makes the underlying morphism of a morphism of covers finite étale.
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Finite.lean` records why that separation axiom is not an artefact of its
  proof.
* **Nothing is assumed of the base `X`** — not Hausdorff, not connected, not non-empty — and
  nothing is assumed of `i` beyond `Mono`.

**Neither hypothesis is derived from the other here, and neither is derived from a hypothesis on
the base — and at this file's meaning of *cover* neither can be.** The classical sentence *a cover
of a Hausdorff space has Hausdorff total space* is about `IsCoveringMap`, and a cover here is an
object of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver`, whose structure morphism is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale`. **That class is not `IsCoveringMap`** and its own
docstring says so: unfolded it is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFinite` — a closed underlying
map with finite fibres — together with `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso` — a local
homeomorphism whose stalk maps are isomorphisms — and the first three of those four conditions
are the whole of its topological content, the fourth saying nothing about points.
`LineTwoOrigins.fold` in `OkaTest/FiniteEtaleCancel.lean` has all three onto `ℝ`, which is
Hausdorff, and its total space is not: `LineTwoOrigins.isClosedMap_fold`,
`LineTwoOrigins.finite_fibre_fold`, `LineTwoOrigins.isLocalHomeomorph_fold` and
`LineTwoOrigins.not_t2Space` are all four in this repository already. **So no argument from the
topological content of `IsFiniteEtale` reaches `[T2Space A.left]` from a hypothesis on `X`**, and
both hypotheses below are asked for because at this reading they have to be.

**Under `IsCoveringMap` the classical sentence is true, and every route to `IsCoveringMap` from
finite étale data here asks the hypothesis it would discharge.** Its ingredient is Mathlib's
`IsCoveringMap.isSeparatedMap`, and its home would be `Oka/Topology/Covering/Basic.lean` beside
`IsCoveringMap.isClosedMap` rather than a file about analytic spaces. But of the declarations
under `Oka/` whose conclusion is `IsCoveringMap` — a comment-stripping walk over every one of
them, not a `grep` — the two that take an arbitrary finite étale morphism are
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoveringMap_base_of_isFiniteEtale`, which asks `[T2Space X]` of
its source, and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoveringMap_baseChangeSndBase`, which asks
`[T2Space E]` of its; both are proved from `IsClosedMap.isCoveringMap_of_isLocalHomeomorph`, whose
own `[T2Space E]` is the hypothesis `LineTwoOrigins.fold` shows cannot be dropped. **So that
lemma's separation hypothesis has a witness too**, and its docstring — which reads *A closed local
homeomorphism with finite fibres out of a Hausdorff space is a covering map* and gives the reason
no connectedness of the target is needed — names none.

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Hausdorff.lean` declares seven `T2Space` instances — `ℂ^ι` and `ℂ^n`, an open
subspace of `ℂ^n` and an open subspace of an arbitrary Hausdorff analytic space, a zero locus in
each of the two spellings, and the node — **and it is not the only file that declares one.**
Walking every tracked `.lean` with the same comment stripper, taking each `instance` head whose
conclusion is `T2Space` and reading the declaring module off `scripts/DumpOkaDecls.lean`'s rows
rather than off a path, three more turn up: `ComplexAnalytic.t2Space_analytification`
(`Oka/Analytification/Hausdorff.lean`, in the library), `ComplexAnalytic.t2Space_restrict_punctured`
(`OkaTest/FiniteMorphism.lean`) and `OkaTest.FiniteEtaleOver.t2Space_left_sqOver`
(`OkaTest/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`). **The last of those is a cover's total space**, at one concrete
cover and not in general: its own docstring opens *`sqOver` and not the general case* and says
that `T2Space A.left` does not follow from `T2Space X` for an arbitrary object of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver X`, which is the argument this paragraph makes.
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Hausdorff.lean` names one of the three in its own docstring, saying that
`ComplexAnalytic.t2Space_complexAffineSpace` *Together with* `ComplexAnalytic.t2Space_restrict`
*subsumes* `ComplexAnalytic.t2Space_restrict_punctured`.
**So none of the ten — the seven of that file and these three — removes either hypothesis
below**, and an instance that did would have to state at `IsFiniteEtale` what
`LineTwoOrigins.fold` refutes.

**This paragraph read *A cover of a Hausdorff space has Hausdorff total space; that is a
topological statement, and this repository's `T2Space` instances for analytic spaces are the seven
of `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Hausdorff.lean`*, said of those seven *none of which concludes anything
about the total space of a cover*, and ended *So both hypotheses are asked for, and
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Hausdorff.lean` is where a later seat would put the instance that removes one*,
until 2026-09-07. Each of those three was false when written rather than falsified later, so this
is a correction and not one of this repository's dated records**: the first is false at
`IsFiniteEtale` and true at `IsCoveringMap`, which are not the same class; three of the instances
are declared outside the file named; and one of those three is a cover's total space.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.selfProd`: **the fibre product `A ×_B A` as an
  object of the category of covers of `X`**, structured over `X` through its *second* projection.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.selfProdFst` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.selfProdSnd`: its two projections, as morphisms
  of covers.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.injective_base_of_baseChangeFst_eq`: **the two projections
  agreeing is what injectivity is**, for a finite étale morphism of analytic spaces with Hausdorff
  source. This is the step that reads points off the carrier and the only one that does.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.injective_base_of_mono`: **a monomorphism of complex analytic
  spaces which is finite étale with Hausdorff source is injective on points.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.injective_base_left_of_mono`: **a monomorphism of
  covers is injective on points**, when both total spaces are Hausdorff.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.inducesIsoOnDirectSummand_of_mono`: **a
  monomorphism of covers exhibits its source as a direct summand of its target**, which is
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/DirectSummand.lean`'s statement with its injectivity hypothesis discharged.

## What is not here

* **This is still not the `monoInducesIsoOnDirectSummand` field of
  `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Galois/Basic.lean`'s `PreGaloisCategory`.** That field asks for the
  summand at every monomorphism and under **no** hypothesis whatever; the last result below asks
  for `[T2Space A.left]` and `[T2Space B.left]`. What this file removes from the gap is the
  injectivity hypothesis and nothing else, and the two separation hypotheses are what is left.
* **No `PreGaloisCategory` instance**, and nothing here bears on the other fields: base change
  over a general cospan of morphisms *of covers*, quotients by finite group actions, and the
  preservation of epimorphisms by a fibre functor are each untouched.
* **Nothing about Hausdorffness.** That a cover of a Hausdorff analytic space has Hausdorff total
  space is a topological statement this repository does not make, and deriving either hypothesis
  below from a hypothesis on `X` would need it. **Nothing is added here because at this file's
  meaning of *cover* that statement is false**, as `## Where each hypothesis is spent` argues from
  `LineTwoOrigins.fold`; what is true is its `IsCoveringMap` form, and that is a statement about
  topological spaces whose home is `Oka/Topology/Covering/Basic.lean` and which this file does not
  prove either. **This sentence is unchanged and nothing in it is retired** — the clause added is
  the one that says why the gap will not be closed in the shape the sentence suggests.
* **The refutation is now inside the category, and the *Nothing about Hausdorffness* bullet is
  still exact.**
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.exists_finiteEtaleOver_not_t2Space` exhibits an object of
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver` over
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.complexAffineSpace 1` whose total space is not Hausdorff, over a
  base that is; it is the complex line with two origins, glued from two copies of `ℂ¹` along the
  complement of the origin. **Nothing in that bullet is retired and nothing here weakens it**:
  this repository still does not *make* the statement it names, and what changes is
  only the evidence against it — the argument from `LineTwoOrigins.fold` is about a topological
  space that is not an analytic space, and this one is about an object of the category the two
  hypotheses below quantify over. **Neither hypothesis below is removed or weakened by it**, and
  no declaration of this file is touched.
* **No diagonal and no isomorphism `A ≅ A ×_B A`.** The classical argument's object is not built,
  so nothing below says the fibre product of a monomorphism with itself is its source.
* **Nothing about a general mono of analytic spaces.**
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.injective_base_of_mono` asks its morphism to be finite étale with
  Hausdorff source, because that is what makes the base change exist; a monomorphism of analytic
  spaces with neither is not reached.
