# Coherence of finitely generated ideal sheaves

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoherentStructureSheaf` says that `𝒪_X` is coherent over
itself. This file turns that into the statement downstream users need: the ideal sheaf generated
by finitely many global sections of `𝒪_X` is coherent, and the sheaf of relations between them
is of finite type.

The mechanism is the two-out-of-three stability of coherence, applied to
`sectionsHom : 𝒪 ^ I ⟶ 𝒪`. The only subtlety is that **no coherence of `𝒪 ^ I` is available or
needed**: `SheafOfModules.IsCoherent.image_of_isFiniteType` asks only that the *source* be of
finite type, because the image is a quotient of the source (hence of finite type) and a finite
type subsheaf of a coherent sheaf is coherent. A finite free sheaf of modules is of finite type
by `SheafOfModules.isFiniteType_free`, so nothing more is required.

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.sectionsHom`: the morphism `𝒪_Y ^ I ⟶ 𝒪_Y` given by
  multiplication by a family of global sections, computed on sections over an open set by
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.val_app_sectionsHom`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.idealSheaf`: the ideal sheaf they generate, defined as
  the image of `sectionsHom`, with its inclusion `idealSheafι` into `𝒪_Y`.

## Main results

- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isCoherent_idealSheaf`: on a locally ringed space with
  coherent structure sheaf, a finitely generated ideal sheaf is coherent.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isFiniteType_kernel_sectionsHom`: the sheaf of relations
  between finitely many global sections is of finite type. On `ℂ^n` this is Oka's coherence
  lemma, read through the sheaf-of-modules formalism.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isCoherent_cokernel_sectionsHom`: the quotient
  `𝒪_Y ⧸ (f₁, …, f_k)` is coherent.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.not_isZero_cokernel_sectionsHom_of_germ_mem`: that
  quotient is **not** the zero sheaf, as soon as the `f i` have a common zero. Coherence holds of
  the zero sheaf, so without this the results above are consistent with being about nothing. It
  rests on `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.not_epi_sectionsHom_of_germ_mem`, which is the
  same statement read through `Epi`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isZero_cokernel_sectionsHom_one`: the converse extreme,
  that the quotient by the unit ideal *is* zero. This is what makes the hypothesis of the
  previous result necessary rather than decorative.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoherent_idealSheaf`: the same for a complex analytic space,
  where the hypothesis is discharged by the main theorem.

## Implementation notes

`LocallyRingedSpace.IsCoherentStructureSheaf` is a `def`, not an `abbrev`, so instance search
does not unfold it; coherence of `𝒪_Y` has to be introduced in its unfolded form
`(SheafOfModules.unit Y.ringSheaf).IsCoherent` before the stability lemmas will fire. The same
reducibility boundary is why `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Noetherian.lean` registers two forms of the
stalk instance.

The non-vacuity results go through `Epi` rather than through the sections of the cokernel,
because the cokernel of a morphism of sheaves of modules is a sheafification and its sections
are not computable term by term, whereas `Epi f ↔ IsZero (cokernel f)` in an abelian category
and `Epi` is exactly what `Oka/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/LocallySurjective.lean` makes
elementary. Reading the resulting equation of sections in `Γ(V, 𝒪_Y)` is a matter of type
ascription only: the scalar action of `SheafOfModules.unit Y.ringSheaf` on itself and its
restriction maps are definitionally the multiplication and the restriction maps of `𝒪_Y`.

the finite type of the source `𝒪_Y ^ I` is used. The quotient is the structure sheaf of the
closed subspace cut out by the `f i`, so this is what makes the theory of coherent sheaves
available on an analytic subspace rather than only on the ambient space. -/

An epimorphism of sheaves of modules is locally surjective
(`SheafOfModules.isLocallySurjective_toSheaf_map_of_epi`), so `1` would be an
`𝒪_Y`-combination of the `f i` on some neighbourhood `V` of `y`. Taking germs at `y` puts `1` in
the ideal generated by the germs of the `f i`, which is contained in the maximal ideal. -/
