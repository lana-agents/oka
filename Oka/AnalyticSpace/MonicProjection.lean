# The projection of a monic hypersurface to its base is finite

Let `i : X ⟶ ℂ^(n+1)` be a closed embedding of complex analytic spaces whose image is the zero
locus of a function which, in the last variable, is a **monic polynomial of one fixed degree**
with continuously varying coefficients — a Weierstrass polynomial, in the case this development
is aiming at. Then the composite

    X ⟶ ℂ^(n+1) ⟶ ℂ^n

with the projection forgetting the last coordinate is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFinite`:
closed, with finite fibres.

This is the topological half of *the analytification of a standard étale morphism is finite
étale*; `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimpleZeroStalk.lean` is the stalk half, for the same composite
`i ≫ ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.proj`, and the two are what
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale` asks for.

## Where the mathematics is, and it is not here

**All of it is in `Oka/Topology/Algebra/Polynomial.lean`**, which is in the mirror tree and
mentions nothing analytic: the roots of a monic polynomial are bounded by its coefficients, so a
closed set of roots of a continuous family has closed image in the parameters
(`Polynomial.isClosed_fst_image_of_monic`) and meets each fibre in a finite set
(`Polynomial.finite_inter_fst_preimage_of_monic`). This file is the assembly, and it is three
steps:

* **a criterion** — `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_comp_of_isClosedEmbedding` reduces
  `IsFinite (i ≫ p)` to those two statements *about the image of `i`*, which is what lets the
  projection be used even though it is not itself finite
  (`ComplexAnalytic.not_isFinite_proj`);
* **a carrier bridge** — `ComplexAnalytic.uliftSnocHomeo`, the homeomorphism
  `ℂ^(n+1) ≃ₜ ℂ^n × ℂ` splitting off the last coordinate, across which the two set-level
  statements are read; it is the analogue of `ComplexAnalytic.puncturedHomeo` in
  `OkaTest/FiniteMorphism.lean`, which plays the same role for `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_sq`;
* **the image of `i`** — `ComplexAnalytic.range_base_eq_of_isCutOutBy` turns
  `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy`'s `range_base` field, which is phrased with germs and maximal
  ideals, into the vanishing of a function, by `germ_mem_maximalIdeal_iff`.

## The three spellings of the hypothesis on the image

`ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_comp_proj_of_range_subset` takes the image of `i` as a set
**inclusion**, `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_comp_proj_of_range_eq` as a set **equation**, and neither
asks anything about structure sheaves; `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_comp_proj_of_isCutOutBy` takes
`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy i.toLRSHom ![F]` and the pointwise identity between `F` and the
family. **The inclusion is the general one and the other two are corollaries of it** — it is what
a source cut out by **more** equations than the family gives, which is the analytification of a
base algebra's hypersurface (`Oka/Analytification/HypersurfaceFinite.lean`); a caller holding an
equation should still quote **the equation form**, which is one line of the inclusion and keeps
its own name and its consumers. **The equation form** is the one a hand-built morphism satisfies —
`OkaTest/FiniteMorphism.lean` explains why cut-out data for a *hand-built* morphism of analytic
spaces still has to be built by hand, which is a claim about those morphisms and not about the
category: `ComplexAnalytic.isCutOutBy_analytificationInclHom` produces the datum for the
inclusion of an analytification into `ℂ^n`, and nothing built by hand is one — and it is what
`OkaTest/MonicProjection.lean` applies.
**The `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy` form** is the one the Weierstrass line will consume, and is two
lines of the equation form.

**None of the three takes the family from `F`.** The family `q` is an argument, and the hypothesis
relating it to `F` is an equation the caller proves; nothing here extracts the coefficients of a
holomorphic function in its last variable, and no holomorphy of the coefficients is used —
continuity is all the mathematics needs, and it is all that is asked for.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.uliftSnocHomeo`: **the last coordinate splits off `ℂ^(n+1)` as a
  homeomorphism onto `ℂ^n × ℂ`**, compatibly with the projection
  (`ComplexAnalytic.base_proj_eq`).
- `ComplexAnalytic.range_base_eq_of_isCutOutBy`: **a hypersurface cut out by one global section
  of `𝒪_{ℂ^m}` has that section's zero set for its image.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_comp_proj_of_range_subset`: **a closed subspace of a monic
  hypersurface is finite over the base**, the hypersurface being the zero locus of a continuous
  family of monic polynomials of one fixed degree. Both obligations are asked only along the image,
  so an image strictly inside the hypersurface is no harder — which is what a subspace cut out by
  further equations, such as the analytification of a base algebra's hypersurface, needs.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_comp_proj_of_range_eq`: **the projection of a monic hypersurface to
  its base is finite**, the case of the above where the image is the whole hypersurface.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_comp_proj_of_isCutOutBy`: the same with the hypersurface presented as
  a cut-out by one global section rather than as a set.

## What is not here

* **No `IsFiniteEtale`, and no `IsLocalIso`.** The stalk half is
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimpleZeroStalk.lean` and the topological half of `IsLocalIso` — that the
  underlying map is a local homeomorphism — is neither here nor there. Nothing below says the
  composite is open, and for a monic family with repeated roots it is not a local
  homeomorphism at all, so this is not a gap that closes by an argument of the same kind.
* **No open subset of the base — this is no longer absent, and it is not in this file.** `i`
  lands in the whole of `ℂ^(n+1)` below, and that has not changed; what has is that the transport
  exists. `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_comp_projRestrict_of_range_eq` in
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenBaseProjection.lean`, which imports this file, is the theorem below with
  `ComplexAnalytic.uliftSnocHomeo` replaced by its restriction `ComplexAnalytic.cylinderHomeo` to
  the cylinder over an open `V`. The standard étale line wants it because such an algebra inverts
  a polynomial as well as cutting one out, so its analytification lives in an open subspace, as
  it does in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimpleZeroStalk.lean` and for the same reason. The paragraph that
  used to stand here predicted that **what is missing is the bridge and not the mathematics**,
  because the mirror-tree theorems take an arbitrary topological parameter space; that came out
  right — `Polynomial.isClosed_fst_image_of_monic` and
  `Polynomial.finite_inter_fst_preimage_of_monic` are instantiated at `V` there, and
  `Oka/Topology/Algebra/Polynomial.lean` gained nothing.
* **No Weierstrass polynomial.** Nothing here produces the family `q` from a germ, which is what
  `Oka/Weierstrass.lean`'s preparation theorem is for; the family is a hypothesis. In particular
  the degree is *fixed*, not merely bounded — a family whose leading coefficient degenerates has
  roots escaping to infinity and the projection is then not closed, which is why
  `Polynomial.isClosed_fst_image_of_monic` asks for `natDegree = d` and not `≤ d`.
* **No bound on the fibres.** A fibre is finite; that it has at most `d` points is
  `Polynomial.card_roots'` and is not specialised, here or in the mirror tree.

The coordinates of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.complexAffineSpace` are indexed by

`Fin.lastCases`, which is what makes the two round trips one `Fin.lastCases` each.

`ComplexAnalytic.base_proj_eq` is the compatibility that makes it the right bridge: the first

`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy`'s `range_base` field states the image as the set where every germ

`germ_mem_maximalIdeal_iff`. The `Fin 1` quantifier disappears by `fin_cases`.

Stated for one section because a hypersurface is what the finiteness theorem below is about; the
same proof at `Fin k` would give the intersection of the `k` zero sets. -/

/-! ### Finiteness of the projection -/

variable {d : ℕ} {W : AnalyticSpace.{u}}

/-- **A closed subspace of a monic hypersurface is finite over the base.**

`i` is any closed embedding of `W` into `ℂ^(n+1)` whose image is **contained in** the zero locus
of the family `q` of monic polynomials of one fixed degree `d`, read in the last coordinate; the
conclusion is that `i` followed by the projection forgetting that coordinate is closed with finite
fibres.

The whole proof is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_comp_of_isClosedEmbedding` at the two
set-level theorems of `Oka/Topology/Algebra/Polynomial.lean`, transported across
`ComplexAnalytic.uliftSnocHomeo`. **Continuity of the coefficients is the only analytic input and
it is a hypothesis**: no holomorphy is used, and `hc` is what a Weierstrass polynomial supplies.

**Why the hypothesis is an inclusion and not the equality
`ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_comp_proj_of_range_eq` asks for.** Both of the theorem's obligations are
*downward* closed in the image — a smaller image inherits them: closedness of `π '' t` is asked
only of subsets `t` of that image, and the fibre obligation asks a set to be finite. So an image
sitting strictly inside the hypersurface is no harder, and this is the form a subspace cut out by
**more** equations than the one monic polynomial needs — the zero locus of a presentation with
relations of its own, which is the analytification of a base algebra's hypersurface, is such a
subspace and the equality is then unavailable.
`ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_comp_proj_of_range_eq` is this theorem at `Eq.subset` and keeps its name
and its consumers. -/
