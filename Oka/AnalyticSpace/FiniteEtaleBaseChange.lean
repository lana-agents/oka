# Base change of a finite étale morphism of complex analytic spaces

Let `q : E ⟶ B` be finite étale and let `f : B' ⟶ B` be **any** morphism of complex analytic
spaces. Then the fibre product `E ×_B B'` exists, its projection to `B'` is finite étale again,
and the square is a pullback in `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`. **No separation axiom is asked
of any of the three spaces**, and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.doubledLineFold` is a finite
étale morphism whose source is not one — `OkaTest/FiniteEtaleBaseChangeNonHausdorff.lean`
compiles every statement of this file at that leg.

**The opening sentence read *Let `q : E ⟶ B` be finite étale with `E` Hausdorff* and the file
carried `[T2Space E]` in its `variable` block, until 2026-09-14**, when the route through
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoveringMap_baseChangeSndBase` was replaced by the two
statements named in `## Where each hypothesis is spent`. The hypothesis was never spent on the
conclusion: it bought a covering map where a closed local homeomorphism is what
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_coveringSpaceHom_of_isClosedMap` asks for, and that
statement was added to `Oka/AnalyticSpace/CoveringSpace.lean` on 2026-09-13 by `7b7ce5a`. **The
constructions are unchanged**: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChange` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChangeSnd` differ from what they were only in which proof of a
`Prop` is passed to `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.coveringSpace`, so by proof irrelevance the
terms are the same and no consumer is transported.

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean` records the absence of this base change in its
`## What is not here` bullet **No base change of the class over a general cospan**, and again in
the docstring of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.fintypeFiberFunctor`. **That bullet
was headed *No pullback over a general cospan, so no base change* when this sentence was written
and until 2026-09-08**, when `Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackReduction.lean` made
`CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPullbacks ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` a theorem and the first half of
the heading stopped being true; only the heading moved and what this file narrows is what it
always narrowed. **The bullet is narrowed by this file and is not narrowed to nothing, and this
file does not make that category a Galois category.** Those axioms quantify over cospans of
morphisms *of covers*, and a morphism of
covers is not known to be finite étale without `[T2Space]` of its target, which is taxis #1772's
remaining half; nor is a cover's total space assumed Hausdorff anywhere in that file. The four
further sentences of that file which cite the bullet by its heading are unaffected, and it says
so.

## The route, and why it touches no local model

The construction is the topological one, carried across by `Oka/AnalyticSpace/CoveringSpace.lean`.

1. **The carrier is Mathlib's set-level pullback** `Function.Pullback q.base f.base`, a subspace of
   the product, and its second projection is a covering map with finite fibres — by
   `IsCoveringMap.pullback_snd` and `Function.Pullback.finite_fiber_snd`, both in
   `Oka/Topology/Covering/Basic.lean`, applied to
   `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoveringMap_base_of_isFiniteEtale`.
2. **A covering map of the base carries an analytic structure for free.**
   `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.coveringSpace` puts `π₂⁻¹𝒪_{B'}` on that carrier and
   `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_coveringSpaceHom` makes the second projection
   finite étale. Nothing is glued: that file's docstring says why the `ℂ`-algebra structure lands
   in global sections and needs no cover.
3. **The first projection is a morphism out of an inverse image**, and that is what
   `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.inverseImageMap` is for. Composed with the comparison
   isomorphism `E ≅ q.base⁻¹B`, which exists because `q` is a local isomorphism, it lands in `E`.
4. **The universal property is the uniqueness in
   `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.inverseImage_hom_ext`** — twice, once for each half. A
   morphism into `π₂⁻¹B'` is pinned by its base map and its composite to `B'`, and the base map of
   a morphism into a set-level pullback is pinned by its two components.

**No local model, no zero locus, no cutting out and no gluing of spaces occurs anywhere below**,
which is worth saying because the fibre product of analytic spaces is usually built that way and
this repository has a whole ladder of issues doing it that way.

## Where each hypothesis is spent

**`[IsFiniteEtale q]` is the only hypothesis, and no separation axiom is spent anywhere.**
Nothing is assumed of `E`, of `B` or of `B'`, and `f` is an arbitrary morphism — not finite, not
étale, not injective.

**That paragraph opened *`[T2Space E]` is spent exactly once*, in
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoveringMap_baseChangeSndBase`, until 2026-09-14.** That lemma
is still here and still true, and it is still the one place in this file where `[T2Space E]`
appears; what changed is that nothing consumes it. It is kept rather than deleted because it is
guarded, and because the covering-map statement is the one a reader coming from
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/CoveringMap.lean` will look for.

**`[IsFiniteEtale q]` is spent in both of its halves, and each half is spent twice.** Its
`IsFinite` field supplies the finite fibres, through
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.finite_fiber_baseChangeSndBase`, which needs no topology at all,
and the closedness of the second projection, through
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isClosedMap_baseChangeSndBase`, which goes by properness; its
`IsLocalIso` field supplies the local-homeomorphism half, through
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalHomeomorph_baseChangeSndBase`, and the stalk isomorphisms
that make `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.inverseImageIsoOfIsLocalIso` an isomorphism. **The first
projection does not need `q` finite** and the second does not need `q` a local isomorphism; both
are needed for the square to be a pullback, because the space is built out of the covering
property.

**That paragraph opened *`[IsFiniteEtale q]` is spent twice and in two different halves* and named
one statement per half, until 2026-09-14**, when the two statements that replace the covering-map
route were added and each half acquired a second consumer. The sentence was exact when written;
what moved is the route and not the accounting rule.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChange`: **the fibre product `E ×_B B'`**, whose carrier is
  `Function.Pullback q.base f.base` on the nose and whose structure sheaf is `π₂⁻¹𝒪_{B'}`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChangeFst` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChangeSnd`: its two projections.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChangeLift`: the morphism a commuting square induces into it.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.inverseImageIsoOfIsLocalIso`: **the source of a local isomorphism
  is the inverse image of its target along its base map**, as an isomorphism of *locally ringed*
  spaces. `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.coveringSpaceIso` is the analytic-space statement of the
  same fact and neither is stated in terms of the other.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_baseChangeSnd`: **the projection to `B'` is finite
  étale.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChange_square`: the square commutes.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChange_hom_ext`: **two morphisms into the fibre product
  agreeing on both projections are equal.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isPullback_baseChange`: **the square is a pullback.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasPullback_of_isFiniteEtale`: hence `Limits.HasPullback q f`, as
  an instance.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_pullback_snd_of_isFiniteEtale`: and hence
  `Limits.pullback.snd q f` is finite étale — **the base-change statement in the spelling
  `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.IsStableUnderBaseChange` is written in**.

## What is not here

* **This is not `CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPullbacks ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`.** Every
  statement below has a finite étale leg in its cospan and a general cospan has none.
  `#synth CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPullbacks ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` **fails** at the
  commit that adds this file, on my own run, with the category positional so that it is fixed by
  the statement and not by a named argument. Gluing — taxis #1820's rung 3 — is what would close
  that, and this file goes around it rather than through it. **That prediction held**: the class
  became a theorem on 2026-09-08, in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackReduction.lean`, by gluing and by
  nothing else. The `#synth` sentence above is pinned to the commit that adds *this* file and is
  not retired; what this bullet still says is that no statement below is that class.
* **No weakening of `[IsFiniteEtale q]`.** Both of its fields are spent, and
  `## Where each hypothesis is spent` says which statement spends which; nothing below asks for
  less than the class.

  **This bullet read *`[T2Space E]` is not removed and nothing here tries*, and gave as its
  reason that the hypothesis is Mathlib's in the criterion that turns a proper local
  homeomorphism into a covering map, until 2026-09-14.** The reason was exact and is why the
  hypothesis was there; what it did not say is that the criterion is not the only route to the
  conclusion, which is what retired the bullet rather than a recount.
* **No `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.IsStableUnderBaseChange` instance.** That class is a
  statement about the *class* `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale` as a
  `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty`, and nothing below is stated at that spelling;
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_pullback_snd_of_isFiniteEtale` is the statement it
  would be assembled from and the assembly is not here.

  **This bullet gave as its reason that the class quantifies over *all* cospans with a leg in the
  class, including those whose finite étale leg has a non-Hausdorff source, and that nothing
  below reaches one, until 2026-09-14.** The second half stopped being true in the same push that
  removed `[T2Space E]`: the statements below reach every cospan the class quantifies over, and
  `OkaTest/FiniteEtaleBaseChangeNonHausdorff.lean` compiles them at one whose finite étale leg has
  a non-Hausdorff source. What is still absent is the `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty` spelling
  and not the reach.
* **Nothing about the degree.** `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_eq_card_fiber` would say the
  base change has the same number of sheets; the fibres do correspond, by
  `Function.Pullback.fst`, and no statement below says so.
* **No comparison with `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictHom`.** For `f` an open immersion
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackOpen.lean` already builds this pullback, by restriction rather than
  by an inverse image, and the two are not compared here.

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChangeLiftBase_fst`, which is `rfl`, and its hypothesis over
