# Local models, and the analytic spaces they carve out

`Oka/Geometry/RingedSpace/ZeroLocus.lean` makes the zero locus of finitely many global sections
of the structure sheaf of an arbitrary locally ringed space `Y` into a locally ringed space, and
establishes the four properties of its inclusion — closed embedding, range, surjectivity on
stalks, kernels of the stalk maps — that `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy` packages. Assembling them
into that predicate is `isCutOutBy_zeroLocusSubspaceι` below, which lives here rather than in the
mirror tree because `IsCutOutBy` is analytic-space vocabulary. Here we then specialise `Y` to an
open subset of `ℂ^n` and read off the two consequences the definitions of
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Basic.lean` were designed for: such a zero locus is a
`ComplexAnalytic.IsLocalModel`, and it is a `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`.

The `ℂ`-algebra structure is where the two differ. `IsLocalModel` is a statement about the
underlying locally ringed space and follows by unfolding an existential. An `AnalyticSpace`
must in addition carry a ring homomorphism `ℂ →+* Γ(X, 𝒪_X)`, and its charts must be
`ℂ`-linear for it. Both come for free from the closed immersion: pulling the constants back
along `i : X ⟶ Y` gives the `ℂ`-algebra structure, and `ℂ`-linearity of `i` for it then holds
by definition. The only thing to check is that the *identity chart* `X.restrict ⊤ ⟶ X` is
`ℂ`-linear, which is `ComplexAnalytic.isCLinearHom_ofRestrict`: the two ring maps involved are
both `𝒪_X(⊤) ⟶ 𝒪_X(U)` in a preorder category, hence equal. This is `AnalyticSpace.ofCutOut`,
and it applies to *any* closed immersion into an open subset of `ℂ^n`, not only to the zero
loci constructed here.

## The node

The point of the exercise is that the main theorem
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoherentStructureSheaf` now applies to a space which is not
`ℂ^n`. The last section carries this out for the **node** `{z ∈ ℂ² | z₀ z₁ = 0}`, the union of
the two coordinate axes, cut out by the single polynomial `X 0 * X 1` regarded as a
holomorphic function through `OkaRing.ofMvPolynomial`. Its underlying set really is the union
of the axes: that is `ComplexAnalytic.mem_zeroLocus_nodeSection_iff`, which goes through
`mem_zeroLocus_restrict_complexSpace_iff` — a germ of a holomorphic function is a non-unit
exactly when the function vanishes (`germ_mem_maximalIdeal_iff`) — and the stalks of a
restriction are the stalks of the ambient space
(`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.mem_zeroLocus_restrict_iff`).

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOut`: a locally ringed space cut out by finitely many
  holomorphic functions inside an open subset of `ℂ^n` is a complex analytic space.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.zeroLocus`: the analytic subspace of an open subset of `ℂ^n`
  cut out by finitely many holomorphic functions.
- `ComplexAnalytic.nodePoly`, `ComplexAnalytic.nodeSection` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.node`: the node `{z ∈ ℂ² | z₀ z₁ = 0}` as a complex analytic
  space.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.isCLinearHom_ofRestrict`: the inclusion of an open subspace is `ℂ`-linear
  for the restricted `ℂ`-algebra structure, and
  `ComplexAnalytic.isCLinearHom_ofRestrict_constants`, the same statement spelled with
  `constantsAlgMap` so that callers needing that spelling do not have to rewrite.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isCLinearHom_restrictTopIso_inv`: the inverse of `restrictTopIso` is
  `ℂ`-linear, for *any* locally ringed space and any `ℂ`-algebra structure on its global
  sections, and `ComplexAnalytic.isCLinearHom_restrictTopIso_inv_constants`, the same statement
  spelled with `constantsAlgMap`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalModel_zeroLocus`: **the zero locus of finitely many holomorphic
  functions on an open subset of `ℂ^n` is a local model.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoherentStructureSheaf_zeroLocus`: its structure sheaf is
  coherent.
- `ComplexAnalytic.mem_zeroLocus_nodeSection_iff` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.origin_mem_zeroLocus_nodeSection`: the node is the union of the two
  coordinate axes of `ℂ²`, and is not empty.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isCoherentStructureSheaf_node`: Oka's coherence theorem applies to it.

`ComplexAnalytic.isCLinearHom_ofRestrict` already gives this, for the algebra structure spelled

`rfl`. The point of restating it is the *stated* type: a caller that needs the `constantsAlgMap`

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenSubspace.lean` used to do twice. -/

No transport is needed and nothing is computed: `restrictTopIso.inv` composed with `ofRestrict`
is the identity — that is `Iso.inv_hom_id`, since `restrictTopIso.hom` *is* `ofRestrict ⊤` — so
`ComplexAnalytic.IsCLinearHom.of_comp` supplies the linearity from the identity's and
`ComplexAnalytic.isCLinearHom_ofRestrict`'s. In particular this is **free for a general
`AnalyticSpace` carrying its own coefficient field**, not only for `ℂ^n`: the analytic structure
plays no part. -/

which is `rfl`. As with `ComplexAnalytic.isCLinearHom_ofRestrict_constants`, the point is the
*stated* type: `IsCutOutBy` and `IsCutOutBy.existsUnique_liftHom` demand `constantsAlgMap n V`,
so a caller crossing into the `restrict ⊤` presentation of `ℂ^n` can apply this directly. -/
