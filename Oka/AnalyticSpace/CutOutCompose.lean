# Composing cut-out data: cutting a subspace down further, inside the same ambient space

`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy i f` says that the closed immersion `i` exhibits its source as the
subspace of its target cut out by the global sections `f`. `Oka/AnalyticSpace/CutOutCancel.lean`
**cancels** such data: from a datum for `iW : W ⟶ Z` and one for `j ≫ iW : Y ⟶ Z` it produces the
datum for `j : Y ⟶ W`. This file goes the other way
(`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.comp_append`): from a datum for `iW` by `f₁` and one for `j` by the
**pullbacks of `f₂` along `iW`**, it produces the datum for `j ≫ iW` by `f₁` together with `f₂`.

That is the direction a *construction* runs in. A cancellation takes a subspace that is already
known to sit inside the ambient space and re-reads it relative to an intermediate one; a
composition builds a new subspace of the intermediate space and asks what it is inside the
ambient one. **`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOut` is why the question has to be asked**: its
ambient space is fixed by its signature to an open subspace of some `ℂ^n`, so a subspace of a
local model becomes an object of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` only once it is presented as a
subspace of that `ℂ^n|V`, and the presentation is exactly the appended family.

## The consumer, and the case this does not cover

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOutZeroLocus` is the construction this was written for: **a
local model cut down by the pullbacks of finitely many further sections of its ambient `ℂ^n|V` is
again a local model**, with the appended family presenting it. The fibre product of two local
models over a third is the shape that wants it — it is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOut` cut down by the `p` differences of the two composites
to `ℂ^p` — and **this file does not reach it**, because those differences are sections of the
product rather than of the product's ambient space and nothing here manufactures a lift.

**What is needed for that is a lift on a neighbourhood rather than a global one**, and
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.exists_localLift_family`
(`Oka/Geometry/RingedSpace/LocallyRingedSpace.lean`) already supplies one along any morphism whose
stalk maps are surjective, which every cut-out datum's is. Assembling that into a chart is a
`ComplexAnalytic.HasLocalModels` argument over a restriction of a restriction, and it is not here.

**It is in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/ZeroLocus.lean`**, which imports this file — one edge, measured —
and which runs that assembly for the zero locus of finitely many global sections of an *arbitrary*
complex analytic space. **The sentence ending `nothing here manufactures a lift` and the one
ending `and it is not here` are about this file and are unchanged by it**:
`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.comp_append` is still what that assembly's last step calls, and the
lift is still not manufactured below. **What that file supplies is an ingredient of the fibre
product of two local models and not the fibre product**: it cuts a space down by *its own* global
sections, where the paragraph above needs the `p` differences of two composites to `ℂ^p`, which
are sections of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOut` and are exactly that. This paragraph
was added on 2026-09-07 by the push that added that file.

## What each of the four conditions costs

**Nothing here is analysis**; `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.comp_append` is four statements about a
factorisation `j ≫ iW` of closed immersions of locally ringed spaces, and the corollaries below
are it applied to a zero locus. The file is beside `Oka/AnalyticSpace/CutOutCancel.lean` rather
than in the mirror tree because `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy` is declared in this repository.

* **The closed embedding** is `Topology.IsClosedEmbedding.comp` and nothing else. Both halves are
  hypotheses here, where the cancellation had to recover one of them from a preimage.
* **`range_base`** splits over `Fin.append f₁ f₂` in both directions. Left to right, the `f₁` half
  is `hW.range_base` at a point of `Set.range iW.base` and the `f₂` half is `hY.range_base`
  transferred along `iW`'s stalk map. Right to left, **the `f₁` half is what produces the point of
  `W` to work at**: a point of the ambient space at which the germs of `f₁` lie in the maximal
  ideal is in the image of `iW` by `hW.range_base`, and only then does the `f₂` half say anything.
  That asymmetry is the whole difference from the cancellation's proof of the same field.
* **The transfer itself** is that `iW`'s stalk map is a **local** ring homomorphism, so it
  reflects units as well as preserving them; `htrans` in the proof below is that statement and it
  is quoted verbatim from `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.of_comp_append`, where it appears with the
  same two sides.
* **`surjective_stalkMap`** is `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.stalkMap_comp` and the
  composite of two surjections, and asks nothing of either family.
* **`ker_stalkMap` is where the surjectivity of `iW`'s stalk map is spent**, as in the
  cancellation, but through the opposite lemma. Writing `φ` for that stalk map and `ψ` for `j`'s,
  `RingHom.comap_ker` gives `RingHom.ker (ψ.comp φ) = Ideal.comap φ (RingHom.ker ψ)`;
  `hY.ker_stalkMap` presents `RingHom.ker ψ` as a span, which `Ideal.map_span` turns into
  `Ideal.map φ` of the span of the germs of `f₂`; and `Ideal.comap_map_of_surjective` collapses
  `Ideal.comap φ (Ideal.map φ ·)` to a join with `RingHom.ker φ`, which is `hW.ker_stalkMap`.
  The cancellation used `Ideal.map_comap_of_surjective` at the same point, which is the reason
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/CutOutCancel.lean` records that this direction *"is a different proof"*.

## Why the hypothesis is the pullbacks and not an arbitrary family

`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.comp_append` asks that the inner subspace be cut out by the pullbacks
of `f₂` along `iW` — sections of the **ambient** space, carried to `W` — and not by an arbitrary
family on `W`. That is not a convenience: the conclusion presents the composite inside `Z`, and a
family on `W` with no ambient preimage names no ideal of `𝒪_Z`. It is also the exact hypothesis
`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.of_comp_append` *concludes*, so the two are inverse to each other on
the nose and neither needs a compatibility lemma to be read against the other.

**Those pullbacks were spelled `iW.pullbackΓ (f₂ r)` here until 2026-09-07**, which is not a term.
`pullbackΓ` is declared for morphisms of *analytic* spaces
(`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom.pullbackΓ`, an `abbrev` in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Basic.lean`),
and `iW` is a morphism of locally ringed spaces; the statement below writes its action on global
sections out through `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.Γ` instead.

**`scripts/check_docstring_names.py` was silent on it twice over, and the two reasons are
different.** Its candidates are backticked spans with no whitespace in them, so a spelling
carrying an argument was never a candidate at all; and written bare it would have been a
candidate and would have passed — not by resolving, but by that script's **short-head rule**.
`MAX_LOCAL_HEAD` is 2 in that script, and `is_local_binder` accepts a candidate whose head
component is at most two characters and is not a root namespace, as field notation on a local
binder; that test is tried before the field-notation rule and **the tail is not consulted at
all**. `iW` is two characters and is not a root namespace. The same rule is what covers
`hY.range_base` and `hY.ker_stalkMap` in the section above, which happen to be right.

**Four plantings in this checkout on 2026-09-07 say which rule fires, rather than a reading of the
script.** Put a candidate in this paragraph and run the checker. `iW.pullbackΓ` passes at
*0 unresolved*. `iW.zzzBogusNotAName`, whose tail names nothing whatever, passes at *0 unresolved*
too. The same tail under a head one character longer is **reported** at *1 unresolved*, *"names
nothing in the environment"* — and that control is written here as *iWx.pullbackΓ* without
backticks, because backticking it is what would make the checker report it, which is the point.
*Eq.symmm* is reported too, and it is the *not a root namespace* half of the rule that reports
it — a head of two characters is not on its own enough. The head decides and the tail is not
read.

**The second reason was given here as resolution until 2026-09-07** — *"it would still have
resolved, because the head of such a token is a bound variable of the theorem, leaving the checker
no type to consult, and a declaration ending in that component existing anywhere in the
environment is enough"* — and that was inferred rather than run, and is false. It is kept as this
paragraph's dated record and nothing is struck. `scripts/DumpEnvNames.lean` wrote **336927** rows
on that date, **331311** of them declarations and **5616** modules, and among them the constants
named `iW` number **0**, those whose last component is `iW` number **0**, and those with `iW` at
the root number **0**. The field-notation rule needs a proper prefix of the candidate to resolve
to a declaration, which for a two-component name is the head, so it cannot fire here; and the
suffix rule matches whole components, of which `iW.pullbackΓ` is not a run in
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom.pullbackΓ`.

**Neither reason is a defect in the checker — and what a green run settles is narrower than this
paragraph said until 2026-09-07** (*"what it settles is whether a name exists, not whether it
exists at the type it is written at"*, kept here as a dated record). For a citation the short-head
rule accepts, it settles nothing about the tail, not even that the tail names something. So a run
reporting 0 unresolved is not evidence about a spelling whose head is one or two characters and is
not a root namespace.

## An import relation that was inferred rather than measured

The `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOutZeroLocus` bullet read *"that declaration arriving in
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/CutOutProduct.lean`, which is downstream of this file"* until 2026-09-07.
**The two files are incomparable.** Neither is in the other's import closure, and on that date
`Oka.lean` was the only module importing either. The figures that replaced the word are a run of
2026-09-07 over this checkout: closures of **42** and **65** modules under `Oka/`, each counting
the file itself, so importing that file here costs **25** and importing this one there costs
**2**.

**The instrument is worth naming, because the obvious one gets both totals wrong.** A `^import`
regex over the raw file text follows an `import` written inside a comment, and in this tree it
also misses every `public import` line; `scripts/import_cost.py`'s parser masks and matches both,
and it is that parser and that pattern, rather than the script's command line, which produced the
four figures above — the script prices a mirror file against a Mathlib target and does not take
these two module names as arguments. Against the naive regex the same two closures come out at
**28** and **51**, each **14** modules short, all fourteen behind a `public import` under
`Oka/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/`: the modules the naive closure does reach that carry such
an import are `Oka/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/Coherent/Criterion.lean` and
`Oka/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/Coherent/Free.lean`.
At this commit the tree holds eight comment-embedded `import` matches across seven files and every
one of them names a module that does not exist, so it is the `public import` and not the comment
that costs here. **The two costs survive the naive regex unchanged**, 25 and 2 either way, so a
delta that agrees is not evidence that either closure was computed correctly.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.comp_append`: **the composition** — if `iW` cuts out `W` inside `Z`
  by `f₁` and `j` cuts out `Y` inside `W` by the pullbacks of `f₂` along `iW`, then `j ≫ iW` cuts
  out `Y` inside `Z` by `Fin.append f₁ f₂`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.comp_of_range_eq`: the same at the family a caller holds, whose
  range is the union of the two ranges and which need not be a literal `Fin.append`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.zeroLocusSubspaceι_comp`: **the zero locus inside a cut-out
  subspace of the pullbacks of ambient sections is cut out of the ambient space by the appended
  family.** This is the composition at the datum
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isCutOutBy_zeroLocusSubspaceι`, which holds for every
  locally ringed space and every finite family, so the hypotheses of the composition are met by
  something rather than only satisfiable in principle.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOutZeroLocus`: **a local model cut down by the pullbacks of
  further sections of its ambient `ℂ^n|V` is a complex analytic space.** Its closed immersion
  into that `ℂ^n|V` as a morphism of *analytic* spaces is
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOutHom` at the same datum and is not restated here, that
  declaration being in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/CutOutProduct.lean`, which this file does not import and
  which importing would add 25 modules to an import closure of 42; the immersion of locally
  ringed spaces is `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.zeroLocusSubspaceι` composed with `i`,
  and it is what the cut-out datum below is stated about. **This bullet gave that file as being
  downstream of this one until 2026-09-07**, when the relation was measured and the two came out
  incomparable; *An import relation that was inferred rather than measured* says with what.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalModel_zeroLocusSubspace_of_isCutOutBy`: the same conclusion as the
  property rather than as an object.
