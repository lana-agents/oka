# Base change of separated covers along a morphism of the base

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleBaseChange.lean` base-changes **one** finite étale morphism along
**one** morphism of the base, and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_pullback_snd_of_isFiniteEtale` carries the class
across that one square. This file makes the construction a **functor**

    ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver X ⥤
      ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver X'

for `f : X' ⟶ X`, **with no separation axiom on either base**, by supplying the one statement that
was missing — that the base change of a **separated** morphism is separated — and by reading the
functoriality off Mathlib.

**Every statement of this file is about the category of covers separated over the base**, which is
the category the `PreGaloisCategory` ladder of this repository is being built at; that class's
namespace is not in this repository's import closure, so the bare form is written here rather than
the dotted one, which is the spelling `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtale.lean` uses and for
the reason that file gives. **That is a run and not a convention**: at the commit that adds this
module, `#check` at the dotted name in a file importing `Oka` reports an unknown identifier, which
is the same instrument `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtaleLimits.lean` records for the same
claim.

## The separatedness half is Mathlib's, read at this tree's morphism property

`Mathlib/Topology/SeparatedMap.lean:106`, at the revision `lakefile.toml` pins (`v4.32.0`), is

```lean
open Function.Pullback in
theorem IsSeparatedMap.pullback {f : X → Y} (sep : IsSeparatedMap f) (g : A → Y) :
    IsSeparatedMap (@snd X Y A f g)
```

and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.base_baseChangeSnd` is **`rfl`**: the carrier of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChange` *is* `Function.Pullback` of the two base maps and its
projection *is* `Function.Pullback.snd`. So
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isSeparatedMap_baseChangeSnd` below is that theorem applied and
nothing else — no transport, no topology of its own, and no hypothesis beyond the ones
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChange` already carries.

**What is new is the class and not the identification.** That the base map is
`Function.Pullback.snd` is consumed already — `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleBaseChange.lean`
pins base maps with it and `Oka/AnalyticSpace/MonoDirectSummand.lean` reads a point of the
self-product through it. **What no declaration of this repository stated before this file is that
a base change is separated**, and that is two measurements and not an account of what this tree's
separatedness statements are about.

**First, the declarations named after separatedness.** At `ddcc4c6`, the third of the five bases
this module has been cut from,
`git grep -nE '^(theorem|lemma|def|instance|abbrev)' -- 'Oka/'` filtered on the token
`isSeparatedMap` returns **twenty-two header lines in three files** — ten in
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtale.lean`, eleven in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedOver.lean`,
one in `Oka/Geometry/RingedSpace/LocallyRingedSpace/HasColimits.lean`; eighteen named and four
anonymous `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty` closure instances. **Not one of the twenty-two has a
fibre product, a base change or a pullback projection anywhere in its statement**, which is a
reading of the twenty-two statements the grep points at, one by one, and not a second grep. **The
filter is case-sensitive and both spellings of separatedness reach it through the header line**:
in the eighteen through the declaration name, and in the four anonymous instances through the
morphism property `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isSeparatedMap` written into the type. **That the
filter is on the header and not on either spelling is what makes it the right one here**: this
tree says *separated* in two ways — the morphism property, and Mathlib's `IsSeparatedMap` at a
morphism's base map, with `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isSeparatedMap_iff` the statement that
they agree — and the header filter is the one whose output is a set of declarations, which is what
a reading one by one needs. **It is not the wider instrument, and neither spelling-keyed grep sits
inside it.** At that commit `isSeparatedMap.{` matches eight lines under `Oka/`, and
`IsSeparatedMap` written with a root-namespace prefix four, both sets lying entirely inside
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtale.lean`. Against the twenty-two, on `file:line` keys,
`comm -23` returns **all four** of the root-prefixed set and **four** of the eight: the
root-prefixed set is **disjoint** from the twenty-two, each of its hits being a continuation line
of a declaration whose header is among them — `:197` under `:196`, `:205` under `:204`, `:259`
under `:258`, `:358` under `:357` — and the four `isSeparatedMap.{` hits that fall outside,
`:205`, `:229`, `:246` and `:318`, are continuation or body lines in the same way. **Read at
declarations rather than at lines, the root-prefixed grep owns four and all four are among the
twenty-two, while `isSeparatedMap.{` owns eight of which seven are.** The one that is not is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver` itself, declared at `:245` with no
`isSeparatedMap` in its header and with the property in its body, which for an `abbrev` is its
statement: it is the `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.Over` of the meet of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale` and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isSeparatedMap`,
at `⊤` and at the base. **So the header filter has another blind spot
beside the one the paragraph opening *Second, and this is what that grep cannot see* is
about** — a declaration naming the property in its body rather than in its header — and **the
live case is the category this module's functor goes between**. Its statement carries no fibre
product, no base change and no pullback projection either, so the sentence opening *Not one of
the twenty-two* holds of twenty-three declarations and not only of the twenty-two the header
filter returns; I read it with them.

**Second, and this is what that grep cannot see, because it selects on the header line.** A `def`
can assert separatedness without saying so in its header, by discharging it as a field of the
object it builds. **Two on `master` do it for a base change, and they are the only two sites under
`Oka/` at which Mathlib's `IsSeparatedMap.pullback` is applied at all** — which is what bounds the
claim, that theorem being the only route from separatedness of a leg to separatedness of the
projection: the instrument is
`git grep -nE '\.pullback\b' -- 'Oka/'` at that commit, whose every hit I read, and exactly two of
them are applications of that theorem. Both apply it at
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChangeSnd`:
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.selfProd`
(`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtale.lean:372`, the application at `:379`) and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fibreProd`
(`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtaleLimits.lean:249`, the application at `:255`), each written
`((isSeparatedMap_left i).pullback _).comp …`. **So the step is not new and only the name for it
is**: neither `def` states anything, both spend the same identification
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.base_baseChangeSnd` records — which is what lets Mathlib's theorem
land on a base map without transport — and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isSeparatedMap_baseChangeSnd` below is a name for a step this tree
has performed twice without one. **Having the name is what makes the functor's separatedness
obligation a single term** rather than the two-step `IsSeparatedMap.pullback`-then-`comp` those
two `def`s each write out.

**Both measurements above were first taken at `003e38f` and are re-run at every re-cut rather than
carried across one.** The account below is the re-run at `280bb67`, after two of them; the
paragraph below it is the re-run at `ddcc4c6`, after the third; the one after that is the re-run
at `ebee177`, after the fourth, and the one closing this section is the re-run at `7577386`, the
base this module is now cut from, after the fifth. Fifteen commits
separate `003e38f` from `280bb67` and **sixteen**
tracked files under `Oka/` change across them, by
`git diff --name-only 003e38f 280bb67 -- 'Oka/'`; **four of the fifteen commits touch a file under
`Oka/` at all**, `7b7ce5a`, `954b116`, `b79ab9b` and `280bb67`. **One of the three files the
twenty-two live in is among those sixteen** — `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedOver.lean`, which
`280bb67` changes by 64 lines — so what follows is a re-run of each measurement and **not** the
argument from disjointness the earlier cuts of this module could make.

**The header-line grep returns the same twenty-two, in the same three files and in the same
split** — ten, eleven and one — **and the twenty-two declaration names are identical**, only
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedOver.lean`'s line numbers moving, which is `diff` of the two filtered
outputs and not a recount. **What `280bb67` did to two of the twenty-two is *remove* a hypothesis**:
`…FiniteEtaleOver.injective_base_left_of_mono_of_isSeparatedMap` and
`…FiniteEtaleOver.inducesIsoOnDirectSummand_of_mono_of_isSeparatedMap` each lost the explicit
`(hA : IsSeparatedMap ⇑(A.hom.toLRSHom.base))` when `[T2Space E]` came out of
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleBaseChange.lean`. **A removal cannot introduce a fibre product, a
base change or a pullback projection into a statement**, so the reading above holds of the
twenty-two at `280bb67` as it did at the two earlier bases, and I have re-read those two.

**The two spelling-keyed greps and every `comm` answer are untouched, and that is a run**:
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtale.lean` is not among the sixteen, so `isSeparatedMap.{`
still matches eight lines and `IsSeparatedMap` written with a root-namespace prefix four, at the
same line numbers — `:197`, `:205`, `:259`, `:358` and `:205`, `:229`, `:246`, `:318` — and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver` is still declared at `:245`. The
`.pullback` sweep is re-run too: **239** hits under `Oka/` at `003e38f`, at `168ff30` and at
`280bb67` alike, the same two of them applications of `IsSeparatedMap.pullback`. **One of those
two moved and it is the only line number above that did**:
`…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fibreProd` was at
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtaleLimits.lean:240` with its application at `:246` and is at
`:249` and `:255` there, that file being one of the ten `280bb67` touches;
`…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.selfProd` at `:372` and `:379` is unmoved.

**And re-run once more at `ddcc4c6`, the base of the third re-cut, which is one commit past
`280bb67` and the cheapest of the four to account for.**
`git diff --name-only 280bb67 ddcc4c6 -- 'Oka/'` returns **one** file and it is **new**:
`Oka/Topology/Covering/Quotient.lean`, which is the whole of what lana-agents/oka#538 adds under
`Oka/`. **None of the three files the twenty-two live in is among them**, and neither is
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtale.lean`. So every figure of this section is the same run at
`ddcc4c6` as at `280bb67`, and each of these is a run of mine at the new base and not an inference
from the file list: the header filter returns the same **twenty-two** in the same **ten, eleven and
one** split, with `diff` of the two filtered outputs empty and no line number moving;
`isSeparatedMap.{` matches **eight** lines and `IsSeparatedMap` written with a root-namespace
prefix **four**, at `:197`, `:205`, `:259` and `:358`;
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver` is still declared at `:245`; and the
`.pullback` sweep is **239** hits under `Oka/` at `ddcc4c6` as at `003e38f`, at `168ff30` and at
`280bb67`, the same two of them applications of `IsSeparatedMap.pullback`, at
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtale.lean:372` with its application at `:379` and at
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtaleLimits.lean:249` with its application at `:255`.

**And a fourth time at `ebee177`, the base of the fourth re-cut, three commits past
`ddcc4c6`, of which two touch a file under `Oka/`.**
`git diff --name-only ddcc4c6 ebee177 -- 'Oka/'` returns **two** files:
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiberFunctor.lean`, which is **new** and is the whole of what
lana-agents/oka#534 adds under `Oka/`, and `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`, which
lana-agents/oka#555 edits. **Neither is one of the three the twenty-two live in, and neither is
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtale.lean`**, so the argument from disjointness the `280bb67`
cut could not make is available at this one — and each figure is still a run of mine beside it and
not an inference from the file list: the header filter returns the same **twenty-two** in the same
**ten, eleven and one** split, with `diff` of the two filtered outputs empty and no line number
moving; `isSeparatedMap.{` matches **eight** lines and `IsSeparatedMap` written with a
root-namespace prefix **four**, at `:197`, `:205`, `:259` and `:358`;
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver` is still declared at `:245`; and the
`.pullback` sweep is **239** hits under `Oka/`, the same two of them applications of
`IsSeparatedMap.pullback` at the four line numbers above. **What `defff6e` changes in
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean` is a dated record and the correction beside it**, in that
file's paragraph on `attribute [local instance]`, and it touches no bullet the *What is not here*
section below rests on: that is a `git diff` of the file and not a reading of it, and it is why the
byte-identity named in that section is left pinned where it was rather than restated here.
**And a fifth time at `7577386`, the base this module is now cut from, three commits past
`ebee177`, of which two touch a file under `Oka/` and one touches none.**
`git diff --name-only ebee177 7577386 -- 'Oka/'` returns **three** files:
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiberFunctor.lean`, which lana-agents/oka#558 edits and
lana-agents/oka#560 edits again; `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiberFunctorCoproducts.lean`, which
is **new** and is what that second push adds under `Oka/`; and
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtaleCoproducts.lean`, which it edits. lana-agents/oka#559 is
the commit between them and touches no file under `Oka/` at all. **None of the three is one of
the three the twenty-two live in, none is `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtale.lean`, and none
is named by an `import` line of this module**, so the argument from disjointness the `280bb67`
cut could not make is available at this one too — and each figure is still a run of mine beside
it and not an inference from the file list: the header filter returns the same **twenty-two** in
the same **ten, eleven and one** split, with `diff` of the two filtered outputs empty and no line
number moving; `isSeparatedMap.{` matches **eight** lines and `IsSeparatedMap` written with a
root-namespace prefix **four**, at `:197`, `:205`, `:259` and `:358`;
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver` is still declared at `:245`; and the
`.pullback` sweep is **239** hits under `Oka/`, the same two of them applications of
`IsSeparatedMap.pullback` at the four line numbers above. **What the two pushes that touch `Oka/`
state is at the fibre functor of the separated covers and at the finite coproducts of that
category, and neither states anything of a base change**; the two files the *What is not here*
section below rests on, `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleBaseChange.lean` and
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`, are **byte-identical at `ebee177` and at `7577386`**,
which is `git rev-parse` at the two blobs and not a reading, so the byte-identity that section
names stays pinned where it was rather than being restated here.

**Nothing here is a figure carried from a commit this module is no longer cut from.**

## The functoriality is free, and it is the *general* fibre product that makes it so

`CategoryTheory.Over.pullback` (`Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Comma/Over/Pullback.lean:63`) is the
functor `Over X ⥤ Over X'` induced by `f`, and it asks for
`CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPullbacksAlong f` — a fibre product at **every** cospan whose second leg
is `f`, with the first leg arbitrary. `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasPullback_of_isFiniteEtale`
does not discharge that, and the failure is not a matter of unfolding: in a file importing
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleBaseChange.lean` and `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtale.lean`
and not `Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackReduction.lean`, asking for that functor is

```
failed to synthesize instance of type class
  Limits.HasPullbacksAlong g
```

— my own planted run. What discharges it is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasPullbacks` (`Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackReduction.lean:268`), the
instance for a **general** cospan of analytic spaces, and the third import of this file is there
for that and for nothing else. **So this file is a consumer of that instance inside the covers**,
which is what makes the route available at all.

With it, `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.Comma.lift`
(`Mathlib/CategoryTheory/MorphismProperty/Comma.lean:360`) lifts that functor into the subcategory
cut out by the pair of morphism properties, and **`Functor.map_id` and `Functor.map_comp` are not
proof obligations of this file at all**: what `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.Comma.lift` asks for
is that each object's structure morphism is in the property — the two statements below — and that
each mapped morphism is in the morphism property of the comma category, which is `⊤` on both sides
here, exactly as `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver`'s own definition records.

## No separation axiom, at either base, and `280bb67` is what makes that true

**Neither `variable` block below carries a `[T2Space …]`, and that is enforced rather than
asserted**: `.orchestra/validation.sh` runs `lake lint`, `unusedSectionVars` is in the default
set, and an unused separation axiom left in scope fails the build. Both blocks were written with
one while this file was cut from `003e38f` and from `168ff30`, and neither can keep it here.

**What removed them is the base and not this file.** Until `280bb67` (taxis #1976)
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_pullback_snd_of_isFiniteEtale` asked `[T2Space E]` of
the source of its finite étale leg; that is what the functor's object map needed `[T2Space A.left]`
for, and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.t2Space_left` is what supplied it
from `[T2Space X]`. With that hypothesis gone, `[T2Space X]` has no consumer in this file at all.
**The probe is an addition and a build**: the module is exit 0 as written, and putting
`[T2Space (X : Type u)]` back into the block below makes `lake build --wfail` fail on four
`unusedSectionVars` warnings, one per `rfl` statement about the functor. The same is true of
`[T2Space (E : Type u)]` in the first block and its two theorems, where the linter names one at a
time.

**The one line the comma category used to cost is gone with it.**
`CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.Over`'s objects carry their structure morphism with the two
functors of the comma category still written, so the old `[T2Space A.left]` obligation was asked
at `((𝟭 AnalyticSpace).obj A.left)` while
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.t2Space_left` is stated at `A.left`; the
two are definitionally equal, instance search did not bridge them, and the construction carried
one `haveI` at the wrapped spelling for that. **That `haveI` is not here either**, and its absence
is a build and not a reading — deleting it is exit 0.

**Nothing below asks anything of `X'` and nothing asks anything of `X`.** The target category is
formed with no hypothesis on its base, and the separatedness of the base-changed structure
morphism comes from the object's own. **The total spaces are not known to be Hausdorff here**,
which is the one thing a reader loses by it: `…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.t2Space_left` is an
instance only over a Hausdorff base, and no statement below uses it or needs it.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.baseChangeFunctor`: **the base change
  functor between the categories of separated covers**, asking no separation axiom of either base.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isSeparatedMap_baseChangeSnd`: **the base change of a separated
  morphism is separated**, at the `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChangeSnd` spelling.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isSeparatedMap_pullback_snd_of_isSeparatedMap`: **and at the
  `CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback.snd` spelling**, which is the one the functor consumes.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.baseChangeFunctor_obj_left` and
  `…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.baseChangeFunctor_obj_hom`: **the functor's value is the ambient
  fibre product with its second projection**, both `rfl`, so a reader need not unfold the lift.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.baseChangeFunctor_map_left_fst` and
  `…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.baseChangeFunctor_map_left_snd`: **the two triangles of a mapped
  morphism**.

## What is not here

* **This is not `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.IsStableUnderBaseChange` for
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale`, and the bullets recording that absence are not
  narrowed.** That class is a statement about the *class* as a
  `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty`, assembled over every cospan with a leg in it; nothing below
  is stated at that spelling and no assembly is attempted here. **What separates the two is not a
  separation axiom**, and at this base it cannot be: `280bb67` took `[T2Space E]` out of
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleBaseChange.lean`, that file's own bullet records the retirement of
  exactly this reading, and `OkaTest/FiniteEtaleBaseChangeNonHausdorff.lean` compiles the base
  change at a cospan whose finite étale leg has a non-Hausdorff source. **What is missing is the
  assembly**, and the bullets in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleBaseChange.lean` and
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean` say at `ddcc4c6` what they say without this file, those
  two files being byte-identical at `280bb67` and at `ddcc4c6`.
* **No `PreGaloisCategory` instance and no `FiberFunctor` one.** Neither class is in this
  repository's import closure at the commit that adds this module, by the `#check` the section
  opening *Every statement of this file* records, so neither can be cited by name in a statement
  here; and base change is not a field of either. What this file bears on is the shape in which
  those axioms are usually stated and not on any field of them.
* **No adjunction.** `CategoryTheory.Over.mapPullbackAdj` is Mathlib's adjunction between
  `CategoryTheory.Over.map` and `CategoryTheory.Over.pullback`; its left adjoint sends an object
  over `X'` to one over `X` by composition, and nothing here says that composition keeps a
  separated cover a separated cover — the composite of two finite étale morphisms is finite étale,
  but `f` is an arbitrary morphism of analytic spaces. **The statement is missing and so is the
  mathematics of one half of it**, and a push that wants the adjunction owes both.
* **Nothing identifying `baseChangeFunctor (𝟙 X)` with the identity, and no composition law.**
  `CategoryTheory.Over.pullbackId` and `CategoryTheory.Over.pullbackComp` are the ambient
  statements; neither is read through the lift here, and a functor's value is what this file
  states rather than how it composes.
* **No comparison with the fibre product of this category.**
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fibreProd` of
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtaleLimits.lean` base-changes an object of this category
  along a morphism **of this category**, over a base that does not move; this functor moves the
  base and lands in a different category. **The two modules are siblings** — neither imports the
  other — and no statement below reads one of that file's declarations.
* **Nothing about the fibres or the degree.** The object is the ambient fibre product, whose
  carrier is `Function.Pullback` and whose fibres correspond by `Function.Pullback.fst`; no
  statement below mentions `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_eq_card_fiber`.
* **The functor is not shown faithful, full or conservative**, and nothing below bears on the
  fibre functor `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.fintypeFiberFunctor` or on the
  factorisation of it through a base change.
* **Nothing in this repository consumes this file at the commit that adds it**, which is the shape
  `OkaTest/Axioms.lean` asks a module to declare rather than leave to a reader: no module imports
  it but `Oka.lean` and its guards in `OkaTest/Axioms/Morphisms.lean`. What consumes it next is a
  fibre functor stated as a base change to a point, and the functoriality of the fibre of a cover
  in the base — neither of which exists here.

`CategoryTheory.Over.pullback` composed with the forgetful functor of the comma category, lifted
back into it by `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.Comma.lift`. The two proof obligations of that
lift are the object's pair — that the second projection is finite étale, by
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_pullback_snd_of_isFiniteEtale`, and that it is
separated, by `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isSeparatedMap_pullback_snd_of_isSeparatedMap` — and
the two morphism conditions, which are `⊤` on both sides and are discharged by the anonymous
constructor.

**`CategoryTheory.Functor.map_id` and `CategoryTheory.Functor.map_comp` are not proved here**:
they are the ambient functor's, and the lift does not restate them.

**No separation axiom is asked of `X` or of `X'`**, and the `haveI` this construction carried for
one — `[T2Space A.left]` at the comma category's wrapped spelling of `A.left` — went out with the
hypothesis `280bb67` removed from
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_pullback_snd_of_isFiniteEtale`. -/
