# A covering space of a complex analytic space is a complex analytic space

Let `X` be a complex analytic space and `p : E → X` a local homeomorphism of topological spaces.
Then `E` carries a complex analytic structure — the inverse image `p⁻¹𝒪_X` of the structure sheaf
— for which `p` is a morphism of analytic spaces, and that morphism is a local isomorphism. If `p`
is moreover a covering map with finite fibres it is **finite étale**.

This is the Riemann existence theorem's topological input: it is what turns a topological covering
of an analytic space into an object of the category the theorem compares with finite étale
algebras.

## The `ℂ`-algebra structure is not glued, and that is the design

`ComplexAnalytic.HasLocalModels` is a *property* and is local on the space
(`ComplexAnalytic.HasLocalModels.of_iSup_eq_top`), but the `ℂ`-algebra structure is *data* landing
in **global** sections, so it does not restrict from a cover for free —
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Local.lean`'s docstring is explicit about the difference, and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofOpensCompatible` is the constructor that glues one from
structures on the members.

**Nothing here glues anything.** `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.inverseImageHom` is a
morphism `p⁻¹X ⟶ X` defined on the whole of `p⁻¹X`, so `X`'s structure pulled back along it is
already a structure on the global sections of `p⁻¹X`
(`ComplexAnalytic.inverseImageAlgMap`), and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofHasLocalModels` is
all that is needed. The cover is used for the *property* and for nothing else.

That is what sidesteps the gap
`Oka/Geometry/RingedSpace/LocallyRingedSpace/InverseImageSheet.lean` records under its
`## What is not here`: *"No cocycle and no gluing. Two sheets `V₀`, `V₁` meeting give two
isomorphisms over `p '' (V₀ ∩ V₁)` and nothing here compares them."* Two sheets are never
compared below, so the naive `p '' (V₀ ∩ V₁) = p '' V₀ ∩ p '' V₁` — **false** for a covering map,
as that file's counterexample shows — is never needed.

## The cover, and what each member costs

The members are the **sheets**: `sheetOpens ⇑p`, the opens of `E` on which `p` is an open
embedding, which cover by `IsLocalHomeomorph.sSup_sheetOpens`. Over one sheet `V` the three
inputs compose with nothing left over:

* `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.sheetIso` identifies `(p⁻¹X)|V` with `X|(p '' V)` as
  locally ringed spaces;
* `ComplexAnalytic.isCLinearHom_sheetHom` makes that identification `ℂ`-linear — an isomorphism
  of locally ringed spaces between analytic spaces can be antiholomorphic, so this half is not
  decoration. It is not, however, what `ComplexAnalytic.HasLocalModels.of_iso` is handed below:
  after `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.sheetIso_hom` that obligation is the by-definition
  `ComplexAnalytic.isCLinearHom_comapAlgMap`, and the sheet linearity reaches the assembly one
  level down, through the next bullet;
* `ComplexAnalytic.comapAlgMap_sheetHom` says the structure the sheet inherits *is* the ambient
  one restricted, which is the side of the seam `of_iSup_eq_top` states its hypothesis on. **This
  is the lemma `ComplexAnalytic.isCLinearHom_sheetHom` is consumed by**: the sheet linearity is
  what makes that equality of structures true.

So the member obligation is `ComplexAnalytic.HasLocalModels.restrict` on `X` and two rewrites.

## Finiteness is the only thing that is not already here

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso` costs nothing: its topological field is
`IsCoveringMap.isLocalHomeomorph`, or the hypothesis itself, and its stalk field is the instance
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isIso_stalkMap_inverseImageHom` — *every* stalk map of the
inverse image is an isomorphism, for an arbitrary continuous map.

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFinite` is *closed base map* and *finite fibres*. The second is a
hypothesis; the first is not implied by it and is `IsCoveringMap.isClosedMap` in
`Oka/Topology/Covering/Basic.lean`, added for this file. It is the one new piece of mathematics
in this line and it is topology, not analysis.

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/CoveringMap.lean` goes the other way — finite étale implies covering map — and
needs `[T2Space]`, because Mathlib's criterion separates the points of a fibre. **This direction
needs no separation axiom**, and none is assumed below.

## Uniqueness, and the reading of it that carries no transport

**A local isomorphism over `X` is this construction, at its own base map.** For `q : E' ⟶ X`
*any* morphism of complex analytic spaces with `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso q`, its
source is isomorphic **over `X`** to the space built below on `q`'s own base map. That is the
reading of *"the structure is unique"* delivered here, and it is a choice among several.

That shape is also what makes the statement cheap. The literal reading — *given an analytic
structure on the topological space `E`, and a morphism whose base map is equal to `p`* — needs an
equality of `TopCat` objects and an equality of morphisms across it, and every statement about it
then carries a transport. `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.coveringSpace` takes the local
homeomorphism as an argument, so the comparison space is built out of `q`'s own base map: `p` and
the hypothesis on it are then not hypotheses of the uniqueness statement at all, being read off
`q`. It is also *stronger* than the literal reading, because it pins the morphism and not only the
space.

**The `ℂ`-linearity of the inverse is where the work is, and it is not decoration.**
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isIso_toInverseImage` gives an isomorphism of *locally
ringed* spaces out of the stalk field of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso` and nothing
else. That is **not** an isomorphism of analytic spaces: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` is a
**non-full** subcategory of `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace` — a
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom` is a `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.Hom` *plus* a proof
of `ComplexAnalytic.IsCLinearHom` — so an isomorphism downstairs hands back an inverse about whose
`ℂ`-linearity nothing has been said, and complex conjugation is a ring automorphism of the sheaf
of holomorphic functions. That is the same fact `Oka/AnalyticSpace/InverseImageSheet.lean` states
for a sheet. `ComplexAnalytic.IsCLinearHom.of_comp` read at `CategoryTheory.IsIso.inv_hom_id` is
the one line that closes it, and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.forgetToLocallyRingedSpace` being
faithful is what closes the two triangle identities.

**Agreement on stalks alone would not have been this statement**, which is worth saying because it
is the cheap thing a reader may expect to find here.
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.stalkInverseImageIso` makes the stalk of `p⁻¹X` at `e` the
stalk of `X` at `p e`, and `IsLocalIso q` makes `q`'s stalk map an isomorphism, so *both* stalks
are canonically `X`'s stalk at the image point and any stalkwise agreement between them is
`IsLocalIso`'s own content restated. It says nothing whatever about the structure sheaves away
from a point, which is the entire question.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.inverseImageAlgMap`: the `ℂ`-algebra structure on `p⁻¹X`, pulled back from `X`
  along the whole of `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.inverseImageHom`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.coveringSpace`: **the complex analytic space on the source of a
  local homeomorphism into a complex analytic space.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.coveringSpaceHom`: the morphism of complex analytic spaces it
  carries, whose underlying map is `p`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.toCoveringSpace`: **the comparison morphism** from the source of
  a local isomorphism `q` to the covering space built on `q`'s own base map. It is the identity on
  carriers.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.coveringSpaceIso`: the isomorphism of complex analytic spaces
  that comparison morphism is.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.hasLocalModels_inverseImage`: **the inverse image of a complex analytic space
  along a local homeomorphism has local models**, which is the whole of the object-level content.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.base_coveringSpaceHom`: the underlying map is `p` on the nose.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_coveringSpaceHom`: **a local homeomorphism into a
  complex analytic space is a local isomorphism** for this structure.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_coveringSpaceHom` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_coveringSpaceHom`: **a covering map with finite
  fibres is finite étale** for this structure.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.toCoveringSpace_comp`: the comparison morphism is a morphism
  over `X`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isIso_toCoveringSpace`: **it is an isomorphism of complex
  analytic spaces**, its inverse's `ℂ`-linearity included.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.exists_iso_coveringSpace`: **uniqueness** — every local
  isomorphism of complex analytic spaces over `X` is this construction at its own base map, and
  compatibly with the two maps to `X`.

## What is not here

* **No uniqueness of the comparison morphism, and none of the isomorphism.**
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.exists_iso_coveringSpace` says an isomorphism over `X` exists and
  exhibits one; nothing below says it is the *only* morphism over `X` whose base map is the
  identity. `CategoryTheory.sheafifyLift_unique` is where that would come from, and
  `Oka/Geometry/RingedSpace/LocallyRingedSpace/InverseImage.lean`'s own `## What is not here` says
  so at the rung the argument would be run on. Naturality in `q` is missing for the same reason
  and is not stated either.
* **No statement for a `q` whose base map is *equal to* a given `p`.** The uniqueness above is
  read at `q`'s own base map, which is exactly what frees it of transport — see the module
  docstring. A consumer who arrives holding `p`, a proof that `q`'s base map equals it, and a
  structure on the carrier has to cross that equality, and nothing here does it for them.
* **The comparison with `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.sigma` is no longer absent, and it is not
  in this file.** The trivial `ι`-sheeted cover `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.sigmaFold` is
  finite étale, hence a local isomorphism, so
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.exists_iso_coveringSpace` applies to it and says that `sigma`'s
  own structure **is** the one this file puts on its source, over `X`. That instance is
  `ComplexAnalytic.exists_iso_sigmaFoldCoveringSpace` in `OkaTest/CoveringSpace.lean`, beside the
  same statement for the squaring map and for an open subspace.
* **Nothing about the number of sheets.**
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.card_fiber_eq_of_isFiniteEtale` in
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/CoveringMap.lean` is that statement, over a preconnected base — but it is
  **not** free for the morphism below, and two things stand in the way. It asks `[T2Space]` of the
  *source*, which is Mathlib's hypothesis, used to separate the finitely many points of a fibre,
  and is exactly the separation axiom this direction otherwise does without; `E` is arbitrary
  here, so there is nothing to synthesise. And
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_coveringSpaceHom` is a theorem rather than an
  instance, so it has to be supplied by hand. A caller holding `[T2Space E]` gets the statement by
  carrying that instance across the carrier seam with `inferInstanceAs` and supplying the
  finite-étale one; a caller without one does not get it at all. The same barrier stands one file
  further on: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_eq_card_fiber` in
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Degree.lean`, which is where a reader looking for the number of sheets *as a
  number* will land, asks `[T2Space]` of the source for the same reason and through the same
  lemma. Nothing below states either.
* **No sections of `p⁻¹𝒪_X`.** No formula is proved for the sections over an open set, here or in
  either file below — over a sheet the *space* is identified with the base and that is strictly
  weaker than a formula, which is all a chart needs.
* **The converse is no longer absent either, and the same bullet says what still is.** A morphism
  of analytic spaces that is finite étale has a covering map for its underlying map
  (`Oka/AnalyticSpace/CoveringMap.lean`, which needs `[T2Space]`), and the structure its source
  carries is now identified with the one built here by
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.exists_iso_coveringSpace` — which needs no separation axiom,
  since it reads only `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso`. What is **not** here is the
  round trip as an equivalence: no functor either way, no naturality, and nothing about morphisms
  of covers.
