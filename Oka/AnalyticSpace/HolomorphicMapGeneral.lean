# `Hom(Z, ℂ^m) ≃ Γ(Z, 𝒪_Z)^m` for every complex analytic space

For a complex analytic space `Z` and a family of `m` global sections of `𝒪_Z`, a morphism of
complex analytic spaces `Z ⟶ ℂ^m` pulling the coordinates back to them:

```
ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.exists_hom_complexAffineSpace_general
    (Z : AnalyticSpace) (g : ULift (Fin m) → Γ(Z, 𝒪_Z)) :
  ∃ φ : Z ⟶ ℂ^m, ∀ j, coordPullback φ j = g j
```

Uniqueness (`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_complexAffineSpace`) has been `m`-fold and
general in `Z` since taxis #653, so this makes
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.homComplexAffineSpaceEquivGeneral` a bijection
`Hom(Z, ℂ^m) ≃ Γ(Z, 𝒪_Z)^m` for an arbitrary complex analytic space — taxis #610. Existence was
previously known `m`-fold only for `Z = ℂ^n`, and for a general `Z` only at `m = 1`.

## `ℂ^m` is not built as a product, and could not be

**Nothing in the development gives products of complex analytic spaces, and nothing here needs
them.** `ℂ^m` is a concrete space and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.okaMapOpen` maps into it
directly from a family of holomorphic functions on an open subset of `ℂ^n`, so the `m` sections
travel together through one chart and one local morphism from beginning to end. The route that
*would* need a product — take the `m` morphisms `Z ⟶ ℂ` that the `m = 1` statement gives and
assemble them — is not available and is not used. `ComplexAnalytic.nodeToLine_ne` is what makes
that concrete: the node's two coordinate functions give two different morphisms `node ⟶ ℂ`, and
no operation in the development combines them into the single morphism `node ⟶ ℂ²` that
`OkaTest/HolomorphicMapGeneral.lean` obtains from the theorem below.

Consequently **`m` enters the proof in exactly two places**: the family version of the local
lift, and one `section_ext_of_cover` per coordinate in the gluing. Everything else — the chart,
the cover, the `ℂ`-linearity, the compatibility on overlaps — is independent of `m`.

## The `m = 1` statements

`exists_hom_complexLine_general`, `exists_hom_complexLine_of_local`,
`exists_hom_complexLine_restrict` and `homComplexLineEquivGeneral` all remain, and each is the
`m = 1` case of its `m`-fold sibling **instantiated rather than reproved**. They are kept rather
than deleted because the `m = 1` spelling — one section, one equation, no index — is what their
callers use, and because `homComplexLineEquivGeneral` is genuinely a different statement: it is
a bijection onto `Γ(Z, 𝒪_Z)`, not onto `ULift (Fin 1) → Γ(Z, 𝒪_Z)`. That is the choice taxis
#720 asked to be made explicitly; it extends the one taxis #655 made rather than reopening it.

## The three steps

1. **The chart step** — `exists_chartLift`. Near each point, the whole family `g` consists of
   pullbacks of sections of `𝒪_{ℂ^n|V}` along **one** chart — one chart for all `m`, which is
   what makes step 2 possible without a product. The chart comes from
   `AnalyticSpace.local_model` and does not depend on `g` at all; the sections from
   `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.exists_localLift_family`, which intersects the finitely
   many opens the single-section version returns, applied not to the chart `i` itself
   but to `i` **composed with the inclusion of its target into `ℂ^n`** — which is what makes the
   lifted section live on an open of `ℂ^n` rather than on an open of `ℂ^n|V`. Taxis #709
   predicted three seams here; this removes one of them before it appears, and the two that
   remain are the ones listed below.
2. **The local morphism** — `exists_local_hom_of_chartLift`: compose the chart with the morphism
   `ℂ^n|V ⟶ ℂ^m` that `exists_hom_complexAffineSpace_restrict` builds from those sections. That
   one is a single line, because `okaMapOpen` was `m`-fold already and only its *statement* was
   one-dimensional.
3. **The gluing** — `exists_hom_complexAffineSpace_of_local`.

## What the gluing needs, and where each part comes from

* **The overlaps must be analytic spaces**, so that uniqueness applies to them. That is
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrict` (taxis #664), and it is why
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.existsUnique_glueMorphisms_of_opens` (taxis #693) rather
  than the pullback-form gluing is the theorem used: the categorical pullback of two open
  subspace inclusions is not an analytic space, so the compatibility hypothesis of the older
  lemma cannot be met by the tool meant to meet it.
* **The compatibility itself is uniqueness, not a computation.** Two local morphisms restricted
  to an overlap have the same `j`-th coordinate pullback there — both are `g j` restricted — so
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_complexAffineSpace` says they are equal. That is
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictLE_comp_eq`. **It is also why the two
  independence-of-choices arguments the original plan for this theorem called for are not
  needed**, and why `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticAt.dslope_comp`, built for one of them, is still
  consumed by nothing.
* **The glued morphism must be recognised as a morphism of *analytic* spaces**, and its
  coordinate pullback must be recognised as `g`. Both are equalities of global sections that
  hold on each member of the cover, so both are
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.section_ext_of_cover`. `ℂ`-linearity is a condition on
  global sections only (`ComplexAnalytic.IsCLinearHom`), which is what makes this work.

## What the chart step needs, and the seam that made it hard

`exists_localLift` produces a section over an open subset `A` of the chart target and, in
general, over nothing larger. Two seams follow, and they are not symmetric.

* **The source open lives in `Z|U₀`, not in `Z`.** `X|U|W` and `X|W'`, for `W'` the image of `W`,
  are two open immersions into `X` with the same image, so `IsOpenImmersion.lift` produces the
  comparison morphism and `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.Γ_map_over_ambient` computes its
  action on sections. No isomorphism is needed — only a morphism over `X`.
* **The chart's sheaf map has to be evaluated on a section that does not extend.**
  `restrictHom_fac` computes `Γ.map (restrictHom i A).op` only on sections pulled back from the
  global sections of the chart target, and `restrictHom` is an `IsOpenImmersion.lift`, so its
  sheaf map is not otherwise computable. `ComplexAnalytic.Γ_map_restrictHom_toRestrictΓ` is what
  closes this, entirely on stalks.

**Neither needed an equation of opens.** The obvious plan is to reach for
`U.isOpenEmbedding.isOpenMap.functor.obj ⊤ = U` and transport along it. Getting that equation is
not the difficulty — it is `TopologicalSpace.Opens.isOpenEmbedding_obj_top`, a Mathlib `@[simp]`
lemma. **Transporting along it is**, and it is never necessary:
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.germ_res_apply` moves a germ across a `≤`, and the two
inequalities one needs — `functor.obj O ≤ U` and `O ≤ (Opens.map ι).obj (functor.obj O)` — are
the `.le` of that same `@[simp]` lemma and the unit of `IsOpenMap.adjunction`. Every predicted
transport evaporates.

The equation is nonetheless not *definitional*, even at `⊤` and even over `ℂ^n` — taxis #702 —
so a transport really would have to be carried, not discharged by `rfl`. Both facts are needed
to see why the `≤` route is the cheap one.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictLE_comp_eq`: **two local morphisms to `ℂ^m` with the
  same coordinate pullbacks agree on the overlap.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.coordPullback_ofRestrict_comp`: restricting a global morphism
  to `ℂ^m` supplies the local data, with the sections restricted along.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.exists_hom_complexAffineSpace_of_local`: **a family of global
  sections which is locally a tuple of coordinate pullbacks is globally one**, and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.exists_hom_complexLine_of_local` at `m = 1`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.exists_local_hom_of_chartLift`: a chart on which the whole
  family lifts supplies the local morphism.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.exists_chartLift`: **near each point, a family of global
  sections of `𝒪_Z` consists of pullbacks of sections of `𝒪_{ℂ^n|V}` along one chart.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.exists_hom_complexAffineSpace_general`: **every family of `m`
  global sections of `𝒪_Z` is the tuple of coordinate pullbacks along a morphism `Z ⟶ ℂ^m`**,
  and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.exists_hom_complexLine_general` at `m = 1`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.homComplexAffineSpaceEquivGeneral`:
  **`Hom(Z, ℂ^m) ≃ Γ(Z, 𝒪_Z)^m`**, with
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.homComplexAffineSpaceEquiv_eq` identifying it at `Z = ℂ^n` with
  the `ℂ^n` bijection that already existed.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.homComplexLineEquivGeneral`: **`Hom(Z, ℂ) ≃ Γ(Z, 𝒪_Z)`**. Not
  an instance of the previous one — its target is `Γ(Z, 𝒪_Z)` rather than
  `ULift (Fin 1) → Γ(Z, 𝒪_Z)` — but its surjectivity is.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.symm_homComplexAffineSpaceEquivGeneral_coordPullback` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.coordPullback_symm_homComplexAffineSpaceEquivGeneral`, and the
  same pair for the `m = 1` bijection: **both round trips**, which is what makes the choice term
  in each inverse harmless to a consumer.

/-- **A family of `m` global sections of `𝒪_Z` which is locally the tuple of coordinate
pullbacks of a morphism to `ℂ^m` is globally one.**

The cover is indexed by the points of `Z`, each point contributing the neighbourhood the
hypothesis supplies for it; that is a `Type u` because the carrier is, which is what
`existsUnique_glueMorphisms_of_opens` requires of its index type.

The glued morphism arrives as a morphism of *locally ringed* spaces. Both remaining obligations
— that it is `ℂ`-linear, and that its `j`-th coordinate pullback is `g j` — are equalities of
global sections which hold after restriction to each member of the cover, so both are
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.section_ext_of_cover`. `ℂ`-linearity being a condition on
global sections *only* is what makes the first of those an instance of the second, and is also
why it does not have to be reproved per coordinate: **`m` enters this proof in exactly one
place**, the second `section_ext_of_cover`, which is now run once for each `j`. -/

Nothing is claimed about the chart beyond its being a morphism of analytic spaces: it need not

inside the proof, for the stalk-surjectivity that `exists_localLift` needs.

**The chart is composed with the inclusion of its target into `ℂ^n` before the lift is taken.**
That is the one design choice that matters: `exists_localLift` then produces its section over an
open of `ℂ^n` rather than over an open of `ℂ^n|V`, so the chart target of the conclusion can be
that open itself and no comparison of `ℂ^n|V|A` with `ℂ^n|A'` is ever needed. The composite is
still surjective on stalks, because the inclusion of an open subspace is an isomorphism on
stalks. -/

/-- **Every family of `m` global sections of `𝒪_Z` is the tuple of coordinate pullbacks along a
morphism of complex analytic spaces `Z ⟶ ℂ^m`, for every complex analytic space `Z`.**

This is the existence half of taxis #610, and the last of it that was open.

Note what does *not* appear in the proof: any product of analytic spaces. `ℂ^m` is a concrete
space and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.okaMapOpen` maps into it directly from a family of
holomorphic functions, so the `m` sections are carried by one chart and one local morphism
throughout. Assembling `m` separate morphisms `Z ⟶ ℂ` into one `Z ⟶ ℂ^m` would need a product
and is never done. -/

/-- **`Hom(Z, ℂ) ≃ Γ(Z, 𝒪_Z)` for every complex analytic space `Z`**, the correspondence being
the pullback of the coordinate.

Injectivity is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_complexLine`, which has been general in `Z`
since taxis #653; surjectivity is `exists_hom_complexLine_general`.

**This is the only bijection of this shape in the development.** There were briefly three — one
for `ℂ^n`, one for `ℂ^n|V`, and this one — with the same forward map at three sources; the first
two are subsumed by this at `Z = ℂ^n` and `Z = ℂ^n|V` and were deleted rather than kept in
parallel (taxis #655). Their *existence* halves, `exists_hom_complexLine` and
`exists_hom_complexLine_restrict`, are not redundant and remain: the second is what
`exists_local_hom_of_chartLift` consumes, so the general case is built on the special one rather
than replacing it.

This is `Equiv.ofBijective`, so **its inverse is a choice term**. The forward map is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.coordPullback` and is the thing to state results about; the two
lemmas below say what the inverse does without unfolding the choice, and that is what a consumer
needs. -/

nothing. This is the half that says the choice is pinned on the image. -/

the tuple of pullbacks of the coordinates.

Injectivity is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_complexAffineSpace`, which has been
`m`-fold and general in `Z` since taxis #653; surjectivity is

`homComplexAffineSpaceEquiv`'s inverse is named on `okaMap` in
