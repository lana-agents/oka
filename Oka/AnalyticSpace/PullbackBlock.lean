# The transition data of a fibre product glued over a family of opens

`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Pullbacks.lean` builds the fibre product of schemes by gluing the
pullbacks `Uᵢ ×_Z Y` taken over the members of an affine cover of `X`. The transition data of that
gluing — the overlaps `v i j`, the swap `t i j` between `v i j` and `v j i`, the induced map `t'`
on triple overlaps, and the cocycle law `t' i j k ≫ t' j k i ≫ t' k i j = 𝟙` — is a block of
declarations that mentions no scheme theory at all: it is bookkeeping about pullbacks in a
category, and the only thing it asks of that category is that the pullbacks it names exist.

**This file is that block for `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`, together with what the consumer of
the block needs and the block does not supply.**

## The consumer, and why it decides the shape of this file

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Glue.lean`'s entry points, `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofGlueData` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofGlueDataCLinear`, take an
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData`, and that file's header records the absence of a
glue datum over `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` as a decision rather than as an oversight. So a
`t'` stated over `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` — which is what transcribes for free — is not the
`t'` that datum wants: its `t'` is a morphism between pullbacks taken in
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace`, and those are different objects.

**The whole content of the second half of this file is that they differ by an isomorphism, and
that the isomorphism is already in the tree.**
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isPullback_map_pullback_pullbackFst_ofRestrict` says that
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.forgetToLocallyRingedSpace` carries the analytic pullback square at
a cospan of two `CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback.fst`s at open-subspace inclusions to a pullback
square, and the cospan of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.fV i j` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.fV i k` is exactly of that shape. Reading that square as a
`CategoryTheory.IsPullback.isoPullback` gives
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.isoPullbackFV`, and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.t'Map` is the analytic `t'` **conjugated** by it.

Nothing downstairs is reproved. The cocycle law downstairs,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.t'Map_cocycle`, is the analytic one with the conjugating
isomorphisms cancelled, and it mentions none of the six `cocycle_*` lemmas the analytic cocycle is
proved from.

## What is hypothesised rather than derived, and why

The ambient limits `Uᵢ ×_Z Y` enter as `[∀ i, CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPullback
(X.ofRestrict (U i) ≫ f) g]` and not from any instance of this repository. That is Mathlib's own
shape — its block quantifies over a scheme cover and takes the ambient pullbacks as given — and
here it also keeps the file's import to `Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackOpen.lean` alone. A caller
supplies the hypothesis from wherever it has one; `Oka/AnalyticSpace/CutOutFibreProduct.lean`'s
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasPullback_ofCutOut` is one such source, at a cospan of local
models presented by cut-out data, and **no declaration of this file is stated about that cospan or
about any other property of those limits.**

**The index is a family of opens and not a cover.** No declaration below asks the `U i` to cover
`X`: the block is bookkeeping about overlaps and is true of any family. Joint surjectivity is what
the *glue* needs — the glued object, its two projections and the proof that it is the fibre
product — and none of that is here. There is still no `structure OpenCover` over
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` in this repository, and this file does not introduce one, because
the block gives no reason to choose between reusing
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.OpenCover` and bundling an analytic one.

**Every member map is syntactically an `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofRestrict`, and after
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackOpen.lean` that is load-bearing rather than tidy**: both
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isOpenImmersion_map_pullbackFst_ofRestrict` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isPullback_map_pullback_pullbackFst_ofRestrict` are keyed on that
spelling, and a member map given as a general open immersion would be reached by neither.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.v`, `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.t`,
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.fV` and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.t'`:
  **Mathlib's transition data, transcribed**, with the three `t_*` factorisation lemmas,
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.t_id`, the six `t'_*` factorisation lemmas and the six
  `cocycle_*` lemmas that go with them.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.cocycle`: **the cocycle law upstairs**.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.isOpenImmersion_map_fV`: the image of a member map of the
  overlap datum is an open immersion of locally ringed spaces, which is the instance that lets the
  pullbacks below be taken there at all.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.isoPullbackFV`: **the image of the analytic triple
  overlap *is* the locally-ringed-space pullback of the two member maps.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.t'Map` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.t'Map_cocycle`: **the transition map and its cocycle law
  in the category `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData` is stated over**, obtained from
  the analytic ones by conjugation and by nothing else.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.t'Map_snd`: what the second projection of that map is,
  which is the factorisation a glue datum's `t_fac` field is stated in terms of.

## What this does not do

**It does not build an `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData` and it does not make
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` a category with pullbacks.** The remaining fields of Mathlib's
`gluing` — `f_mono`, `f_id` and `t_fac` — and everything after it — `p1`, `p2`, `gluedLift`,
`pullbackP1Iso`, `gluedIsLimit` and `hasPullback_of_cover` — are not here.
`CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPullbacks ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` does not synthesise at the
commit that adds this file, and no declaration below claims otherwise.

**It says nothing about the ambient cospan.** The comparison this file supplies is at the cospan
of two member maps of the overlap datum, both of which are `CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback.fst` at
an open-subspace inclusion. Whether the analytic `Uᵢ ×_Z Y` is the locally-ringed-space pullback of
`X.ofRestrict (U i) ≫ f` and `g` is a different question, at a cospan neither of whose legs is an
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofRestrict`, and **no declaration of this file bears on it**. That
this file does not need an answer is the reason its transition data is stated with the analytic
objects rather than with locally-ringed-space ones.

Mathlib's `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Pullback.v`, `t` and the three factorisation lemmas for `t`,
with `𝒰.f i` replaced by `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofRestrict` at the `i`-th member of the

about pullbacks in a category and nothing in it is about schemes. -/

`@[implicit_reducible]` for the reason Mathlib's copy carries it:
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.t'` and the six `t'_*` lemmas state morphisms out of
pullbacks *of* this object's projections, and instance search has to see through the definition to
find the pullbacks those mention. -/

Mathlib's `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Pullback.fV`, `t'`, the six `t'_*` factorisation lemmas and the

the pullbacks in `t'`'s statement elaborate without unfolding it by hand. -/

/-- **The inclusion of the overlap into the `i`-th piece.**

An `abbrev` rather than a `def`, as Mathlib's is: it appears inside the pullbacks that `t'`'s
*type* names, so it has to reduce during elaboration of that type, where no `haveI` is reachable.
It is the leg that
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.isOpenImmersion_map_fV` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.isoPullbackFV` are stated at, and it is a
`CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback.fst` at an `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofRestrict`. -/
