# Cancelling a cut-out datum: cutting out inside a subspace rather than inside the ambient space

`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy i f` says that the closed immersion `i` exhibits its source as the
subspace of its target cut out by the global sections `f`. Every datum in this repository cuts a
subspace out of an **ambient** space — `ComplexAnalytic.isCutOutBy_analytificationInclHom` cuts an
analytification out of `ℂ^n`, and `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.restrictOpen` shrinks such a datum
to an open of the same ambient space. This file supplies the missing **cancellation**: given a
datum for `iW : W ⟶ Z` by `f₁` and one for `j ≫ iW : Y ⟶ Z` by `f₁` together with a further
family `f₂`, the morphism `j : Y ⟶ W` cuts `Y` out of `W` by the **pullbacks of `f₂` along
`iW`** (`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.of_comp_append`).

That is what a consumer needs when the ambient space is not where the geometry is: a hypersurface
in `ℂ^(n+1)` cut down by further relations is a subspace of the hypersurface, and a statement
about the smaller one relative to the larger one cannot be read off two data that both point at
`ℂ^(n+1)`.

## What each of the four conditions costs

**Nothing here is analysis and nothing here is about complex analytic spaces**; it is four
statements about a factorisation `j ≫ iW` of closed immersions of locally ringed spaces.

* **The closed embedding** is `IsEmbedding.of_comp` for the embedding half and, for the closed
  half, the observation that `Set.range j.base` is the `iW`-preimage of `Set.range (j ≫ iW).base`
  — which uses only that `iW.base` is injective. That observation is `hrange` in the proof below,
  and the one other field read through it is `range_base`; the two stalk conditions never mention
  it.
* **`range_base`** splits the conjunction over `Fin.append f₁ f₂` into its two halves. The `f₁`
  half is **free and carries no hypothesis about `Y`**: every point of `W` lies in the image of
  `iW`, so `hW.range_base` already puts the germs of `f₁` in the maximal ideal there. The `f₂`
  half transfers along `iW`'s stalk map, which is a **local** ring homomorphism and so reflects
  units as well as preserving them.
* **`surjective_stalkMap`** is `Function.Surjective.of_comp` against
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.stalkMap_comp`, and asks nothing of `hW`.
* **`ker_stalkMap` is the only condition that uses `hW`'s own kernel**, and it is where the
  surjectivity of `iW`'s stalk map is spent. Writing `φ` for that stalk map and `ψ` for `j`'s,
  `RingHom.comap_ker` gives `ker (ψ ∘ φ) = φ⁻¹ (ker ψ)` and `Ideal.map_comap_of_surjective` turns
  that into `ker ψ = φ (ker (ψ ∘ φ))`. The image of the generating set splits: the germs of `f₁`
  lie in `ker φ` by `hW.ker_stalkMap`, so they contribute `0`, and the germs of `f₂` map to the
  germs of their pullbacks.

## Why `Fin.append` and not a subfamily

`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy` is indexed by `Fin k`, so "the big family contains the small one" has
to be spelled. `Fin.append` is the cheapest spelling to *prove* about, because `Fin.addCases`
splits a quantifier over it in one step. It is the wrong spelling for a *caller*, whose family
arrives as a `Fin.snoc` or in the other order, so
`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.of_comp_of_range_eq` restates the same theorem with the hypothesis
`Set.range f = Set.range f₁ ∪ Set.range f₂` and no `Fin.append` in it. **Both directions of that
are free**, because `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy` depends on its family only through its range:
that is `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.of_range_eq`, which is worth having on its own and is stated
first.

## What is not here

* **No converse.** Nothing below says that a datum for `j : Y ⟶ W` and one for `iW` compose to a
  datum for `j ≫ iW`. That direction is true and is a different proof — the kernel computation
  runs the other way and needs `Ideal.comap` of a span rather than `Ideal.map` — and nothing in
  the tree wants it yet.
* **No analytification and no `ℂ^n`.** The consumer this was written for is the local-isomorphism
  half of a standard étale analytification over a presented base, but no statement here mentions
  a polynomial, a presentation, or `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`.
* **No `IsLocalIso` and no transport of any morphism class.**
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_of_isCutOutBy_pullbackΓ` is the consumer that turns
  two cut-out data into a local isomorphism; this file only *produces* the second of its two
  data.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.of_range_eq`: **being cut out depends on the cutting family only
  through its range**, so the family may be reindexed at will.
- `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.of_comp_append`: **the cancellation** — if `iW` cuts out `W` by
  `f₁` and `j ≫ iW` cuts out `Y` by `Fin.append f₁ f₂`, then `j` cuts out `Y` inside `W` by the
  pullbacks of `f₂` along `iW`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.of_comp_of_range_eq`: the same statement at the hypothesis a caller
  holds, `Set.range f = Set.range f₁ ∪ Set.range f₂`.

/-- **Being cut out by global sections depends on the family only through its range.**

Both conditions that mention the family read it through its range: `range_base` is a `∀` over the
index and `ker_stalkMap` is a span over `Set.range`. So a family may be reindexed, repeated or
permuted freely, and in particular the arity `k` is not an invariant of the datum.

This is what lets `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.of_comp_append` be stated at `Fin.append`, which is
convenient to prove about and which no caller holds. -/

/-- **Cancelling a cut-out datum**: if `iW` cuts out `W` inside `Z` by `f₁`, and `j ≫ iW` cuts
out `Y` inside `Z` by `f₁` together with `f₂`, then `j` cuts out `Y` inside `W` by the pullbacks
of `f₂` along `iW`.

The module docstring says what each of the four conditions costs. The one hypothesis that is
**not** used anywhere is `hW.isClosedEmbedding`'s closedness — only the injectivity of `iW.base`
is, and it is read for one thing: to identify `Set.range j.base` as the `iW`-preimage of
`Set.range (j ≫ iW).base`, in `hrange` below. **The embedding half does not read it either**:
`IsEmbedding.of_comp` asks for two continuities and an embedding of the composite, so the
injectivity of `j.base` comes out of `hY`. The closedness of `Set.range j.base` comes from `hY`
too, not from `hW`. -/

/-- **The cancellation at the hypothesis a caller holds.**

`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.of_comp_append` asks for the big family to be literally
`Fin.append f₁ f₂`, and no caller's is: `ComplexAnalytic.hypersurfacePresentation` produces a
`Fin.snoc`, and the subfamily cutting out the intermediate space need not come first. Since
`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy` sees a family only through its range
(`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.of_range_eq`), the honest hypothesis is the set equation, and this
is that statement. -/
