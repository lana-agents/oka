# A trivial fundamental group is a property of the base and not of the point

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimplyConnected.lean` proves that a connected cover separated over a base whose
fundamental group **at a named point** is trivial is the base over itself
(`…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.nonempty_iso_id`). **This file is that implication run backwards.**
Together the two make the triviality of the group a *criterion*: it holds exactly when every
connected cover separated over the base is isomorphic to the base over itself. The right-hand side
of that criterion names no point, so the left-hand side cannot depend on which point is named, and
the two transports at the end of this file are what that observation is worth.

## What the previous module leaves, and the census is a scan rather than a memory

At the commit this file is cut from, `…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.nonempty_iso_id` occurs in the
comment-stripped code of **three** modules — `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimplyConnected.lean`, which
declares it, `OkaTest/Axioms/Morphisms.lean`, the guard file, and `OkaTest/FundamentalGroup.lean`,
which uses it once, contrapositively, to say the punctured line's group is not trivial — and
`…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.exists_iso_coprod_id` occurs in **two**, the first two of those.
`…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fundamentalGroup` occurs in **four** modules and **twelve** places.

**Of those twelve, the three that say the group is trivial are all in one module and all three are
hypotheses.** At that same commit `Subsingleton (…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fundamentalGroup …)`
occurs **three** times in the comment-stripped code of the tree, all in
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimplyConnected.lean` and all as the instance argument of one of its three
theorems, and **no declaration under `Oka/` concluded it**. At the commit that adds this file it
occurs **seven** times, the other four being in this file, and the first theorem below is the
declaration that concludes it — **the sentence before this one is a figure about the base commit,
and this push is what falsifies it**, which is why it is pinned and not written in the present
tense. At both commits the one place the tree decides anything about the group with no hypothesis
left over is `OkaTest/FundamentalGroup.lean`'s `nontrivial_fundamentalGroup`, which concludes the
*failure* of it at the punctured line; what this file adds is an implication and decides nothing
about any base on its own. So a consumer that wanted the hypothesis had no way to get it, and one
that had it at a point had no way to move it.

**Which spelling the scan counts is part of its figure.** The population is every tracked `.lean`
file under `Oka/` and `OkaTest/` together with the two root modules, the stripper is
`scripts/import_cost.py`'s `strip_comments`, and what is counted is the name **not preceded or
followed by a letter, a digit or `_`**, with a `.` allowed before it. That is the spelling
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimplyConnected.lean` publishes and the reason it gives holds here unchanged:
every occurrence of these names in code is dotted.

## The whole of the mathematics is that a terminal object has one automorphism

`CategoryTheory.PreGaloisCategory.autMulEquivAutGalois` identifies the automorphism group of a
fibre functor with the multiplicative opposite of
`CategoryTheory.PreGaloisCategory.AutGalois`, the limit of the automorphism groups of the pointed
Galois objects, and `CategoryTheory.PreGaloisCategory.AutGalois.ext` says an element of that limit
is determined by its projections. A Galois object is connected —
`CategoryTheory.PreGaloisCategory.IsGalois` is declared `extends IsConnected` — so the hypothesis
applies to it and makes it isomorphic to `…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.id X`, which
`…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isTerminalId` says is terminal;
`CategoryTheory.Limits.IsTerminal.ofIso` carries terminality across that isomorphism and
`CategoryTheory.Limits.IsTerminal.hom_ext` then collapses the automorphism group of the Galois
object to one element. Every projection of the limit therefore lands in a subsingleton, and the
limit is one.

**No step of that evaluates anything at the point.** The hypothesis does not mention it; the point
enters only through the functor whose automorphism group is being computed, and it enters the same
way for every point of the base. **That is why the two transports below are one line each and are
not a second theorem**: `…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.subsingleton_fundamentalGroup_congr` is the
criterion at one point composed with the criterion at another, and the second transport is the
first under `not_subsingleton_iff_nontrivial` twice.

**This is not the argument the forward direction runs.** That one goes through the fibre — the
group acts transitively on it, a trivial group makes it a one-point set, and the fibre functor
reflects isomorphisms — and the fibre is where it meets the point. Neither direction is the other
read backwards at the level of proofs; only the statements are converse.

## The two converses of that module, which are different sentences

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimplyConnected.lean`'s `## What is not here` says *The converse direction is
the one this repository can witness, and it is not in this file.* **That is a different converse
from this one and that bullet is not retired by this file.** What it refers to is a *refutation*:
a cover that is not isomorphic to the base over itself refutes the hypothesis, and
`OkaTest/FundamentalGroup.lean` does that at the punctured line. What is below is the *implication*
run backwards — from the conclusion holding for every connected cover to the hypothesis — and it is
a statement about the base and not about any one cover. **The refutation is an instance of the
forward direction and needs nothing here**; nothing in `OkaTest/` is changed by this file.

## What the import costs, measured in the environment and not by a scan

This file's only `import` is `Oka.AnalyticSpace.SimplyConnected`, which is in `import Oka`'s
closure already, so **the cost is zero and it is a run and not a diff**: at the commit this file is
cut from `import Oka` brings **5538** modules and at the commit that adds it **5539**, by a set
difference over `Lean.Environment.allImportedModuleNames`, and the one module the difference
contains is this one. **No Mathlib module enters the closure**, and in particular
`Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Galois/Prorepresentability.lean` — where
`CategoryTheory.PreGaloisCategory.autMulEquivAutGalois` and
`CategoryTheory.PreGaloisCategory.AutGalois.ext`, the two rungs below that
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimplyConnected.lean` does not itself use, are declared — is already there:
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FundamentalGroup.lean` brings it in four steps —
`Mathlib.CategoryTheory.Galois.Equivalence`, `Mathlib.CategoryTheory.Galois.EssSurj`,
`Mathlib.CategoryTheory.Galois.Topology`, `Mathlib.CategoryTheory.Galois.Prorepresentability` —
each of which is an import line of the one before it, the third being the second line of the
second and the other two the first of theirs. The base figure is taken by elaborating the base
`Oka.lean` at this checkout, which imports 5537 modules and is one short of `import Oka` there by
the root module itself. **A marginal import cost is a figure about the importer at a commit and is
meaningless without one**, which is why both are pinned here and neither is in the present tense.

## What the census scripts return

`scripts/DumpOkaDecls.lean` writes **4** rows at this module — the four declarations, with **no**
equation lemma, match lemma or congruence lemma — and the dump total moves **4984 → 4988**.
`scripts/DumpEnvNames.lean` moves **338257 → 338262**, which is those four declarations and this
one module and nothing else.

`scripts/guard_coverage.py` moves guards under `OkaTest/Axioms/` **2007 → 2011**, all four in
`OkaTest/Axioms/Morphisms.lean`; advertised in a `## Main results` **1504 → 1508**, in
**230 → 231** files; and *in both lists* **1362 → 1366**. **`Δguards = Δ(in both) + Δ(nowhere)`
closes at `4 = 4 + 0`**: this module has no `## Main definitions` section, so no guarded name of it
lands in the *guarded and advertised nowhere* row, which is flat at **645**. The *unguarded* row is
flat at **142, in 60 files** — this file opens no gap — *advertised from another file* is flat at
**86**, and *abbreviated citations, not counted* at **30, four of them dotted**.

`scripts/check_docstring_names.py` goes **17962 → 17990** backticked names (**4374 → 4392**
distinct) and **332 → 349** elided citations (**160 → 164** distinct), with **0** unresolved at
both ends, **6** resolving under more than one namespace at both, and **239** dotless at both.
**Both ends of every figure in this section are runs**: the base column is that script and
`scripts/guard_coverage.py` run **in a worktree at the base commit** against dumps synthesised
from the head ones by deleting this module's four rows from the declaration dump and its five —
four declarations and one module — from the environment-name dump, which is exact because both
dumps are per-name and both scripts read the prose of the tree they are run in.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.subsingleton_fundamentalGroup_of_iso_id`:
  **if every connected cover separated over the base is isomorphic to the base over itself, then
  the fundamental group at any point of the base is trivial.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.subsingleton_fundamentalGroup_iff`:
  **and that is a criterion** — the two conditions are equivalent.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.subsingleton_fundamentalGroup_congr`:
  **so triviality of the group at one point is triviality at any other.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.nontrivial_fundamentalGroup_congr`: the
  same transport in the positive form a consumer states.

## The list above is written in full, and this heading is why it ends where it does

**Every head in the list above is the whole name**, with the house `…` elision kept for the prose
outside it, because `scripts/guard_coverage.py` resolves a backticked token of a `## Main results`
section against the declaration dump and an elided one resolves to nothing. That is the trap
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FundamentalGroup.lean` records at length and it is not restated here.

**What is restated is the other half of it, which that module does not have to face**: the same
tool counts *every* backticked token of a `## Main results` section that resolves to nothing, so a
paragraph of prose left under that heading raises the *backticked tokens skipped* row even when
every declaration name in the list is exact. **This heading is what keeps that row flat**: the
`## Main results` section above is four bullets and nothing else, and the row is **702** at both
ends of this push.

## What is not here

* **No base is exhibited in this file whose fundamental group is trivial.** That is the first
  bullet of `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimplyConnected.lean`'s own `## What is not here`, said there of
  that file and true here of this one. **What this file changes is the shape of the question and
  not its answer**: to exhibit one it is now enough to classify the connected covers of a base, a
  statement in which neither the group nor a point of the base occurs. Nothing below does that for
  any base. **The bullet ended *and it is still true of the tree* until 2026-09-20**, when
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimplyConnectedPoint.lean` did exactly what the sentence after it predicts:
  it classifies the connected covers of a base whose underlying space has at most one point —
  each is the base over itself, by a finiteness and a discreteness and no group — and then reads
  `…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.subsingleton_fundamentalGroup_of_iso_id` below at it. **That base is
  a point**, and the tree still exhibits none of positive dimension.
* **The coproduct form of the criterion is not here.**
  `…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.exists_iso_coprod_id` says a trivial group makes every cover a finite
  coproduct of copies of the base over itself; the converse of *that* — from every cover being such
  a coproduct to the group being trivial — is neither stated nor refuted below. **It is not
  obtained by composing anything here**, because the criterion's hypothesis is about connected
  covers one at a time, and the step that gets from the one to the other is
  `…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.nonempty_iso_id_of_iso_coprod_id` in
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimplyConnectedCoprod.lean`, where both directions and the second criterion
  are.

  **Until 2026-09-21 this bullet priced that step at one statement, and named the wrong one**: it
  read *what it needs and this file does not have is that a connected object isomorphic to a finite
  coproduct of copies of a terminal object has a one-element index type.* That statement is true
  and **is not what the step needs**; the index type is never counted. A coprojection into a
  coproduct is a monomorphism — `CategoryTheory.Limits.MonoCoprod.mono_ι`, at the
  `CategoryTheory.Limits.MonoCoprod` instance `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Galois/Basic.lean` declares
  for every `CategoryTheory.GaloisCategory` — so one coprojection composed with the given
  isomorphism is a mono into the connected object and
  `CategoryTheory.PreGaloisCategory.IsConnected.noTrivialComponent` makes it an isomorphism
  outright. **A count of the index type is a consequence of that conclusion and not a step towards
  it**, and the retired clause is kept here rather than struck because a prescription that was
  acted on is worth a record.
* **Nothing relates the groups at two different points.** The transports below carry the
  *triviality* of the group from one point to another, and its *failure* back, through a condition
  that mentions neither point; whether `…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fundamentalGroup x` and
  `…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fundamentalGroup y` are isomorphic as groups is neither stated nor
  refuted below. **Mathlib does relate the automorphism groups of two fibre functors of one
  category when the second is a whiskering of the first, and two points of one base do not give
  such a pair.** `CategoryTheory.PreGaloisCategory.autEquivAutWhiskerRight` is an isomorphism of
  topological groups between the automorphism groups of `F` and `F ⋙ G` at a fully faithful `G`,
  and `CategoryTheory.PreGaloisCategory.FiberFunctor.comp_right` makes `F ⋙ E` a fibre functor
  again when `E` is an equivalence, so a pair of fibre functors of one category *can* be compared
  there — `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Galois/Equivalence.lean` compares such a pair across a universe
  switch. But `…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fintypeFiberFunctor x` and
  `…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.fintypeFiberFunctor y` are not a functor and a whiskering of it, and
  nothing below makes them one. **A route to such a comparison does exist in
  `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Galois/`, and it is in the one module of that folder this repository
  does not import.**
  `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Galois/IsFundamentalgroup.lean` makes a compact topological group acting
  suitably on the fibres isomorphic to the automorphism group of the functor, so a single group
  serving at two points would relate the two; **ten of the eleven modules under
  `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Galois/` are in the environment of `Oka` + `OkaTest` at the commit that
  adds this file and that one is not**, which is why it is cited here by path — its declarations
  resolve to nothing in the dump `scripts/check_docstring_names.py` checks against, so naming one
  would fail that check rather than help a reader. **A transport of a property is not an
  isomorphism of the objects that have it**, and reading the second off the first is the error
  this bullet exists to stop.
* **No comparison with the topologist's fundamental group**, for the reason
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FundamentalGroup.lean`'s own bullet gives.
  `Oka/Analysis/Complex/FundamentalGroup.lean` is a different group of a different kind and
  nothing below bears on it.
* **Nothing about analytification and nothing about a scheme.** This is the analytic side alone.
* **No instance and no definition.** All four declarations below are theorems; this file declares
  no instance and no `def`, and every class instance the four consume is declared elsewhere.
