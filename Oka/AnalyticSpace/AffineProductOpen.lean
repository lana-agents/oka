# The product of two open subspaces of complex affine spaces

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/AffineProduct.lean` makes `ℂ^(n+m)` the binary product of `ℂ^n` and `ℂ^m`.
That is the product of two *affine spaces*, and it is not the object a product of two local
models is built inside: a local model of this development is cut out inside an **open subset** of
some `ℂ^n`. `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.zeroLocus` in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalModel.lean` takes
an open `V` of `complexAffineSpace n` and cuts out inside
`(complexAffineSpace n).restrict V.isOpenEmbedding`, and that locally ringed space is the one
underlying `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrict` at `V` — the two are the same term, which
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrict_toLocallyRingedSpace` says and which was checked with an
`rfl` in a scratch file rather than assumed. This file supplies that object: for
`V : Opens ℂ^n` and `W : Opens ℂ^m`, the open subspace of `ℂ^(n+m)` at
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.affineProdOpens V W` — the meet of the two preimages — **is** the
binary product of `ℂ^n|V` and `ℂ^m|W`.

Every construction here is assembled from declarations this file imports. The object is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrict` at an `Opens.map` of an existing projection; the two
legs and the pair are `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftRestrict`; the triangles are
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftRestrict_fac` and the triangles of
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/AffineProduct.lean`; and uniqueness is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.mono_ofRestrict` against
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_affineProd`. It is an assembly, in the sense
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackOpen.lean` is one.

## The range condition, which is the only step with content

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftRestrict` asks that the range of the base map of the morphism
being lifted lie in the open. For the pair that is the statement that
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.affineProdLift` of two morphisms landing in `V` and in `W` lands in
the meet of the two preimages, and **it is discharged from the triangles rather than from a
formula on points**: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.affineProdLift_fst` says the pair followed by
the first projection is the first morphism, so applying the base map of the first projection to a
point of the pair's image gives a point of the first morphism's image, which lies in `V` by
assumption. The base maps of the two projections computed in this file are not used for it.

`congrArg` produces that equation as a statement about the base map of a *composite*, and `rw`
cannot see through the composite; the `have`s in
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.affineProdOpensLift` therefore carry a type ascription that states
it in the applied form, which is definitionally the same and syntactically what the goal has.

## The base maps

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/AffineProduct.lean` defines its projections by their coordinate pullbacks, and
at `bbbc91f` its `## What is not here` says of that file that it does not compute their base maps
and that no statement in it needs one. This file does compute them, in one rewrite each, because
a consumer that cuts something out of the product will describe the cutting on points:
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.base_eq_eval_coordPullback` in
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/HomToComplex.lean` turns a coordinate of the image point into the value of a
pulled-back coordinate, `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.coordPullback_affineProdFst` says which
coordinate that is, and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.eval_coord` reads it off. The `funext`
form of each — the base map as a function rather than at an index — is one application of
`funext` to the statement given here and is not stated, no declaration in this file consuming it.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.affineProdOpens`: the open of `ℂ^(n+m)` at which a pair of
  opens, one of `ℂ^n` and one of `ℂ^m`, cuts out their product.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.affineProdOpensFst` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.affineProdOpensSnd`: the two legs.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.affineProdOpensLift`: the pair.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.affineProdOpensIsoProd`: the identification of
  `ℂ^(n+m)|affineProdOpens V W` with the categorical product `ℂ^n|V ⨯ ℂ^m|W`.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.base_affineProdFst` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.base_affineProdSnd`: **the base maps of the two coordinate
  projections of `ℂ^(n+m)`**, at an index — the `j`-th coordinate of the image of `w` under the
  first projection is `w` at `Fin.castAdd`, and under the second is `w` at `Fin.natAdd`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.base_affineProdLift`: **the base map of the pair**, which is
  `Fin.addCases` of the base maps of the two morphisms it was assembled from.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.mem_affineProdOpens_iff`: membership of
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.affineProdOpens` is membership of the two images.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.affineProdOpensLift_fst`,
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.affineProdOpensLift_snd` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_affineProdOpens`: the two triangles and uniqueness.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLimitBinaryFanAffineProdOpens`: **`ℂ^(n+m)|affineProdOpens V W`
  with those two legs is the binary product of `ℂ^n|V` and `ℂ^m|W`**, and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasBinaryProduct_restrict_complexAffineSpace` is the instance.

## What is not here

* **`CategoryTheory.Limits.HasBinaryProducts ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`.** What lands here is
  the product at a pair of *open subspaces of affine spaces* and nothing wider. At `bbbc91f`,
  which is this file's base, **with this file added to the tree**, `#synth
  CategoryTheory.Limits.HasBinaryProducts ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` fails — elaborated rather
  than grepped, and that is the form of the probe worth recording, since
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasBinaryProduct_restrict_complexAffineSpace` below could be
  mistaken for it. `#synth CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPullbacks ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` fails
  there too, `Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackOpen.lean` giving the pullback along one leg and not the
  class.
* **The product of two local models.** The product of a subspace cut out in `ℂ^n|V` and one cut
  out in `ℂ^m|W` is cut out inside the object built here, by the two families of functions pulled
  back along the two legs. Nothing below pulls a function back along either leg or takes a zero
  locus in the product.
* **Anything over a base.** Both statements here are absolute products. The fibre product over a
  common base is an equaliser inside such a product, and no construction below builds an
  equaliser or bears on `CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPullback`.
* **The topology of the identification.** `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.affineProdOpensIsoProd`
  is an isomorphism of complex analytic spaces, which carries a homeomorphism of the underlying
  spaces with it; no statement below extracts that homeomorphism or describes it on points.

**The `obtain ⟨j⟩` before the induction is load-bearing.** `Fin.addCases` eliminates a

/-- **The first leg `ℂ^(n+m)|affineProdOpens V W ⟶ ℂ^n|V`**: the inclusion followed by the first
projection, factored through `V`.

The range condition is the first component of the meet, and it is available on the point itself:
a point of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrict` at an open carries its membership in that
open, and here that membership *is* the pair of conditions. -/

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftRestrict_fac`. This equation, rather than
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.affineProdOpensFst` itself, is what the proofs of the two
triangles and of uniqueness consume: the lift is opaque and the composite is not. -/

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.affineProdLift` of the two composites with the inclusions, factored
through the open. The module docstring's section on the range condition says why the two `have`s
are stated in the applied form and how they are proved from the triangles of
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/AffineProduct.lean` rather than from
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.base_affineProdFst` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.base_affineProdSnd`.

**The two goal changes are `change` and not `show`**, and the difference is a build failure rather
than taste: the two spellings are definitionally equal and not syntactically equal, so
`linter.style.show` fires on `show` and `lake build --wfail` turns the warning into an error,
which `lake env lean` on a scratch file does not.
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.mono_ofRestrict` in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenSubspace.lean` records
the same seam for the same reason. -/
