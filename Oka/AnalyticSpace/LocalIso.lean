# Local isomorphisms of complex analytic spaces, and finite étale morphisms

A holomorphic map is a **local isomorphism** when its underlying map is a local homeomorphism and
every stalk map is an isomorphism, and **finite étale** when it is that and finite
(`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFinite`). This is the second rung of the Riemann existence
theorem's analytic side; the first is `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Finite.lean` and the third is
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/CoveringMap.lean`, which deduces from these two that the underlying map of a
finite étale morphism out of a Hausdorff analytic space is a covering map.

## Why two fields, and why one of them is not topological

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFinite` is a condition on the underlying map and nothing else.
**A local isomorphism cannot be**: two analytic spaces with the same underlying space and
different structure sheaves are not locally isomorphic, so the condition has to see the sheaves,
and the two rungs therefore do *not* compose the way `IsFinite`'s two fields do. The definition
below meets that rather than hiding it — one field is topological and one is about stalks, and the
class carries both.

**Why stalks rather than "locally an open immersion".**
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion` is available and one could ask for a cover
of the source on which the morphism restricts to one. That is presumably equivalent — a theorem,
and not proved here — and it is worse to *use* either way: it quantifies over covers, so every
consumer begins by choosing one, whereas the stalk condition is checkable at a point, and this
repository already has the machinery for it: `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy` carries
`surjective_stalkMap` and `ker_stalkMap` as fields, and
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.stalkMap_comp` is what makes the composition below one line.

**Why not `IsCoveringMap`.** Mathlib has it, and it is a *global* condition — every point of the
target has an evenly covered neighbourhood — strictly stronger than being a local homeomorphism.
For a **finite** local isomorphism the two agree, and that agreement is a theorem, of the same
kind as properness-versus-finiteness, which `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Finite.lean` keeps out of its
definition and proves separately as
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_iff_isProperMap_base_and_finite_fiber`. It is not in the
definition and it is not proved here; it is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoveringMap_base_of_isFiniteEtale` in
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/CoveringMap.lean`, the third rung, which imports this file.

**This paragraph used to say "onto a connected base", and connectedness is not a hypothesis of
that theorem.** A point outside the range is evenly covered by the empty index type. What
connectedness gives is that the number of sheets is constant — a different statement, and now a
proved one: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.card_fiber_eq_of_isFiniteEtale`, in the same file as
the rung.

## What is not here

* **The Riemann existence theorem**, and any statement relating covers to field extensions. This
  is the notion RET is *about*; nothing here mentions `ℂ(X)`.
* **A `degree` function on morphisms — this is no longer absent, and it is not in this file.**
  The bullet that used to stand here has been retired in four steps. It first said the constancy
  of the number of sheets over a connected base was not proved anywhere; it is, as
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.card_fiber_eq_of_isFiniteEtale` in
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/CoveringMap.lean`. It then said the common value was computed for no morphism;
  it is, and no longer only for one — `ComplexAnalytic.card_fiber_base_sq` puts the fibres of
  `z ↦ z²` on the punctured line at **2**, by a statement about roots in `ℂ` rather than about
  covers, and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.card_fiber_sigmaFold` puts the fibres of the trivial
  `ι`-sheeted cover at `Nat.card ι`, so every value is realised. **The fourth step retires it
  altogether**: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree` in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Degree.lean` is the
  `Nat`-valued invariant, the well-definedness obligation this bullet made the condition of
  having one is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_eq_card_fiber`, and the consumer it asked
  for is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isHomeomorph_base_of_degree_eq_one`. The two computations
  above are now read as degrees, `ComplexAnalytic.degree_sq` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_sigmaFold`.
* **The analytification of a finite étale morphism** — the other blocker of #551, stateable only
  now that this exists.
* **Cancellation for `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale` — this is no longer absent, and
  it is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_of_comp` at the foot of this file.** A
  Galois-category structure on the finite étale covers of a fixed base —
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver`, in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean` —
  wants *"if `g` and `f ≫ g` are finite étale then `f` is"*. All four halves cancel and **the only
  hypothesis any of them needs is `[T2Space Y]` on the middle space**: three ask nothing at all —
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_of_comp` is both halves of the local-isomorphism rung
  and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.finite_fiber_of_comp` is the fibre half of the finite one —
  and the fourth, closedness of `f`, is
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_comp_of_t2Space` in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Finite.lean`,
  which asks nothing of `g` either.

  **What this bullet used to say was that closedness does not follow**, with the real line with
  two origins over the real line as the witness and the classical graph-and-fibre-product proof as
  the only route. **The witness is right and both conclusions drawn from it were wrong.** It is a
  counterexample, and `TwoIndiscrete.not_isClosedMap_pt_of_isClosedMap_comp`
  (`OkaTest/FiniteEtaleCancel.lean`) now compiles one of the same shape — but what it exhibits is
  a **non-Hausdorff middle space**, and not anything about the second factor: its two origins are
  two points of `Y` that no open set separates. At `[T2Space Y]` the cancellation holds for an
  arbitrary second factor, by `isProperMap_of_comp_of_t2` and the properness of a finite morphism,
  and no separatedness notion and no fibre product is needed at any point.

  This repository still has neither a separatedness notion for `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` nor
  fibre products, which is the same absence `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean` records as
  the reason base change is not statable there. **Neither was ever what obstructed this**; a
  separation axiom on `Y` is a hypothesis and not a construction, and it is the whole of what was
  missing.
* **Grauert's finite mapping theorem**, which `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Finite.lean` already records as
  absent.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso`: **a local homeomorphism whose stalk maps are
  isomorphisms.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale`: finite and a local isomorphism.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_id`, `isLocalIso_comp` and `isLocalIso_of_isIso`:
  the local isomorphisms contain the isomorphisms and are closed under composition.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_of_comp`: **local isomorphism cancels** — if `f ≫ g`
  and `g` are local isomorphisms then so is `f`, and neither half of the proof asks for anything
  this repository had to supply.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_id` and `isFiniteEtale_comp`: the same for finite
  étale morphisms, from the two rungs' versions.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_of_comp`: **finite étale morphisms cancel** — if
  `f ≫ g` is finite étale and `g` is a local isomorphism then so is `f`, for a Hausdorff middle
  space. That separation axiom is the whole cost of it and is spent entirely in the finite rung.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.surjective_base_of_isLocalIso_of_isFinite` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.surjective_base_of_isFiniteEtale`: **a finite local isomorphism
  out of a non-empty space onto a preconnected base is surjective** — the image is open because the
  morphism is a local isomorphism and closed because it is finite, and a preconnected base has no
  other clopen set than `∅` and itself.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.not_isFinite_of_isLocalIso_of_not_surjective`: **the
  contrapositive**, which is the form a non-example is stated in — it refutes finiteness from a
  missing point rather than from a non-closed set exhibited by hand.

/-- **A morphism of complex analytic spaces is a local isomorphism when its underlying map is a
local homeomorphism and every stalk map is an isomorphism.**

The underlying map is spelled `f.toLRSHom.base` and the stalk map `f.toLRSHom.stalkMap`, as
everywhere else here: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom` is a
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.Hom` together with a `ℂ`-linearity condition and its
category structure is defined through `toLRSHom`.

**Note which points the second field ranges over.** `isIso_stalkMap` is quantified over points
of the **source**, so it says nothing at points of the target outside the image. That is a remark
about how to read the field, not a reason the other one is needed: a local homeomorphism can miss
most of the target too.

**Neither implication between the fields is settled here.** No counterexample to either direction
is exhibited and neither is proved, so the two-field definition is a design choice and not a
theorem. What *is* checked is that the topological field is not idle:
`ComplexAnalytic.not_isLocalIso_axisIncl` (`OkaTest/FiniteMorphism.lean`) rules out the closed
immersion of an axis into `ℂ²` **using that field alone** — its own docstring records that nothing
about stalks enters. That
morphism fails both fields, so it witnesses no implication in either direction. -/

`IsLocalHomeomorph.comp` and `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.stalkMap_comp`.

**Why the two stalk hypotheses are passed explicitly, through
`CategoryTheory.IsIso.comp_isIso'`, rather than left to instance search.** After the rewrite the
goal's first stalk is indexed at `(f ≫ g).base x` while `h2` is indexed at `g.base (f.base x)`.
Those are the same point by `rfl` **at default transparency only**: reducing `(f ≫ g).base` to
`g.base ∘ f.base` unfolds the composition of `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.Hom`, which is
not reducible. **Instance search runs at reducible transparency**, so it cannot see that the two
`IsIso` statements are about the same morphism, and neither `infer_instance` with both hypotheses
as local instances nor `apply CategoryTheory.IsIso.comp_isIso` succeeds — the latter unifies the
composite at default transparency and then fails on the very hypothesis in scope, one level down
and by the same cause.

The control is one keyword: `with_reducible exact CategoryTheory.IsIso.comp_isIso' h2 h1` fails
with exactly that mismatch of stalk objects, and removing `with_reducible` compiles. Nothing about
the composite shape is at fault — `CategoryTheory.IsIso.comp_isIso` is an instance and closes the
generic goal; `comp_isIso'` is Mathlib's explicit-argument form, provided for this situation. -/

/-- **Local isomorphism cancels**: if `f ≫ g` and `g` are local isomorphisms, then so is `f`.

**Both halves are free and neither is this repository's work**, which is the content of the
statement rather than a remark about the proof. The topological one is `IsLocalHomeomorph.of_comp`,
whose third hypothesis is the *continuity* of `f` alone — and a morphism's base map is a `TopCat`
morphism, so it carries that with it. The stalk one is
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.stalkMap_comp` read as a factorisation of the composite's
stalk map, plus two-out-of-three in the shape `CategoryTheory.IsIso.of_isIso_comp_left`.

**Nothing is asked of `f` that a morphism does not already have**, so this is a cancellation
statement with no side condition, unlike the finite rung's
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_isFinite_comp`, which asks for injectivity of the second
factor. The module docstring's `## What is not here` says what that difference costs the finite
étale rung.

**It is a `theorem` and not an `instance`, deliberately.** As an instance it would fire on every
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso` goal and ask instance search to invent both the object
`Z` and the morphism `g` to factor through, neither of which is determined by the goal.

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_comp`, directly above, is the composition companion.
**The third position of two-out-of-three — concluding about `g` from `f` and `f ≫ g` — is not
stated here and should not be expected**: both hypotheses see `g` only along the image of `f`, the
stalk field of each being quantified over points of its own source, so `g` is unconstrained away
from that image. No morphism below is asked to witness that, and this sentence is a reading of the
two definitions rather than a theorem. -/

Its underlying map is a homeomorphism and its stalk maps are isomorphisms because the whole
morphism is one. The `haveI` has to be ascribed at `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom.toLRSHom f`
and **not** at `forgetToLocallyRingedSpace.map f`: the two are `rfl`-equal and are different
discrimination-tree keys, so with the second spelling `infer_instance` fails. That seam is
recorded in `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isOpenImmersion_ofRestrict`'s docstring and in
`ComplexAnalytic.range_base_localisationProj`'s; this is its third appearance. -/

This is what the Riemann existence theorem is about on the analytic side. It is stated as a class
of its own rather than as a conjunction so that the instances below are found, and it carries no
field beyond the two.

**It is not `IsCoveringMap`** — that is a condition on the underlying map alone, and this one is
not — but it does imply it for a Hausdorff source:
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoveringMap_base_of_isFiniteEtale` in
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/CoveringMap.lean`. This docstring used to say the implication was unproved; see
the module docstring for why the two notions are still kept apart. -/

/-- **Finite étale morphisms cancel**: if `f ≫ g` is finite étale and `g` is a local isomorphism,
then `f` is finite étale — provided `Y` is Hausdorff.

This is the statement `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean` records as the first thing a
Galois-category structure on `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver` would need, and it is
the two rungs' cancellations put together:
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_comp_of_t2Space` in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Finite.lean`,
and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_of_comp` above.

**`g` is asked to be a local isomorphism and not to be finite étale**, because that is all that is
used: the finite half of the cancellation asks nothing of `g` at all, and the local-isomorphism
half asks exactly this. A caller holding `[IsFiniteEtale g]` — which is the Galois-category case —
has it by `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale.isLocalIso`, so nothing is lost by stating
the weaker hypothesis.

**`[T2Space Y]` is the whole cost of the statement**, it is on the middle space, and it is not
removable; see `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_comp_of_t2Space`, which is where it is
spent and where the witness against dropping it is cited. Whether it can be dropped when `g` is
additionally *finite* étale is not asked here — that witness has a second factor which is not a
local isomorphism, so it does not settle the question.

**It does not make the category Galois**, and `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean` says what
else is wanted: no fibre products, hence no base change. **The fibre functor is no longer among
it** — `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.fintypeFiberFunctor` is in that file, and its
fibres are finite with no hypothesis. **This sentence used to add *and every statement about that
functor beyond its two laws*, and it had already stopped being true one push before the branch
that removed it**: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.base_eq_of_fiberFunctor_map_eq`
falsified it — a statement about that functor, and neither of its laws — and nothing swept this
file when it landed. What retires the clause outright rather than narrowing it is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.hom_ext_of_fiberFunctor_map_eq`, which is
faithfulness wherever its hypotheses hold. What is missing there is base change, and
`CategoryTheory.Functor.Faithful` as a class. -/

/-! ### Surjectivity over a preconnected base -/

/-- **A finite local isomorphism out of a non-empty space onto a preconnected base is
surjective.**

The two rungs pull the image in opposite directions and connectedness closes the gap: a local
isomorphism is a local homeomorphism, hence an open map, so its image is **open**
(`IsLocalHomeomorph.isOpenMap`); a finite morphism has `IsClosedMap` as its first field, so the
image of the whole source is **closed**. On a preconnected base a clopen set is empty or
everything, and a non-empty source rules out empty.

**`[PreconnectedSpace Y]` and not `[ConnectedSpace Y]`**, because that is what the argument reads;
under `[Nonempty X]` the two coincide here, a point of `X` giving a point of `Y`. This headline
and the two below it said *connected* in an earlier draft, which is the slip the module
docstring already records once — there in a place where connectedness was not a hypothesis at
all.

**This is what the module docstring's *"a point outside the range is evenly covered by the empty
index type"* costs.** That sentence is about why
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoveringMap_base_of_isFiniteEtale` needs no connectedness, and it
is right; this says that such a point exists only in the two cases named — an empty source, or a
disconnected base — so the two statements are about the same gap from opposite sides.

**Neither hypothesis is shown necessary here, and both have an evident candidate witness.** Both
fields of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso` quantify over the source and so do both of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFinite`'s, so an empty source satisfies everything above
vacuously and `[Nonempty X]` cannot be dropped by any argument in this file;
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_sigmaι` makes the inclusion of a member of a disjoint
union finite étale for **every** family, which is where a witness against `[PreconnectedSpace Y]`
would come from. **Neither is carried out: these are readings of two theorems and not statements
of this file**, and nothing below asserts that either hypothesis is irredundant.

**`[IsLocalIso f]` and `[IsFinite f]` rather than `[IsFiniteEtale f]`**, because that is what the
proof reads, and a caller holding the class has both by
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale.isFinite` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale.isLocalIso`, which are instances. The `IsFiniteEtale`

It is the only *general criterion* the library has for refuting
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFinite`'s **first** field, and it is **not** the only route this
repository has to that refutation — an earlier draft of this paragraph said it was.
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.not_isFinite_of_infinite_fiber` (`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Finite.lean`)
refutes the second field, and `ComplexAnalytic.not_isFinite_puncturedInclCoveringSpaceHom`
(`OkaTest/CoveringSpace.lean`) refutes the first already, with no fibre anywhere in it — by
exhibiting a non-closed image by hand, which is the route this theorem replaces rather than the
one it is alone against.

**That morphism is an instance of this theorem**, which is a better pedigree than being the only
route would have been: it is a local isomorphism by
`ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_puncturedInclCoveringSpaceHom`, out of a non-empty source, over the
preconnected `ℂ¹`, and its base map is the inclusion on the nose by
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.base_coveringSpaceHom`, so the origin is missed. **The rewrite is
not carried out**: `OkaTest/CoveringSpace.lean`'s own proof is untouched and this paragraph is a
reading of it, not a second proof. -/
