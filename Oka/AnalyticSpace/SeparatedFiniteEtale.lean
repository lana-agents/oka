# Separatedness as a second conjunct, and the category of covers separated over the base

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedOver.lean` proves that a monomorphism of covers separated over a
Hausdorff base exhibits its source as a direct summand of its target, and it says in terms that it
does not make the choice its own statements raise: *"Whether the condition belongs as a field of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale`, as a second conjunct in the morphism property
`FiniteEtaleOver` is built from, or as a class of its own is a choice that has to be made against
a measurement of what it costs the existing statements, and this file is the thing that makes the
measurement possible rather than the thing that makes the choice."*

**This file makes that choice, and it is the second of the three.** Separatedness becomes a
`CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty` in its own right, `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isSeparatedMap`
below, and the category is the one that property cuts out of the covers by intersection:

    SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver X = (isFiniteEtale ⊓ isSeparatedMap).Over ⊤ X

against `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver`'s `isFiniteEtale.Over ⊤ X`. The second `⊤`
is unchanged and deliberate for the reason that file gives of its own: a morphism of separated
covers commutes with the two structure maps and is asked for nothing else.

## What the choice costs, measured rather than asserted

**No declaration that existed before this module is edited**, and that is the measurement rather
than a way of putting it: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale` gains no field,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver` is not redefined, no landed statement acquires a
hypothesis and no landed proof is touched. **The push that adds this module touches four files and
the instrument is `git diff --numstat` against its base**: this one, which is new;
`Oka/Topology/SeparatedMap.lean`, which gains two general-topology statements; the root
`Oka.lean`, which gains one import line; and `OkaTest/Axioms/Morphisms.lean`, which gains a guard
section and the module-docstring clause that section owes. **Five lines are removed anywhere in
it, all five in `Oka/Topology/SeparatedMap.lean`'s header and all five prose** — its title, the
sentence retired there with a dated record, and a bullet restated to cover three statements
instead of one. **That is the whole of the measurement
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedOver.lean` asked for**, and it is the argument for this branch of the
three rather than a remark about it: a field of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale`
would put the condition into every statement that class appears in, and this puts it into none of
them.

**What it does not do is argue that the other two branches are wrong.** A field would make the
condition part of what *finite étale* means in this repository, which is a claim about the
definition and not about a category, and a class of its own would give the condition a home
independent of the covers. Neither is refuted here; what is shown is that the conjunct is
available at no cost to anything already proved, and a branch with that property is worth taking
before one without it.

## The result that is new, and it is not a restatement

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.injective_base_left_of_mono_of_isSeparatedMap`
asks its morphism to be a monomorphism **in the category of covers**. The
`monoInducesIsoOnDirectSummand` field of `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Galois/Basic.lean`'s
`PreGaloisCategory` — whose namespace is not in this repository's import closure and so cannot be
cited by name here — offers a monomorphism **in the category the axiom is stated over**, which
under this choice is the separated one. Those are different hypotheses, and the second is a priori
the weaker: a monomorphism of covers is one here, because every test object of this category is a
cover, while the converse asks a cancellation against test objects this category does not contain.
**Whether they coincide is not settled here and nothing below claims it.**

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.injective_base_left_of_mono` is the
statement at the weaker hypothesis, and **the reason it goes through is that `A ×_B A` is itself
separated over the base**. The cancellation in the ambient proof happens against that object and
against nothing else, so it is enough that the object be in this category —
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.selfProd` is where that is discharged, and
it is discharged in two steps: `IsSeparatedMap.pullback`, Mathlib's, makes the projection
`A ×_B A ⟶ A` separated because `i` is, and `IsSeparatedMap.comp` composes that with `A`'s own
structure morphism. **`i` is separated because `A` is** — its structure morphism factors through
`i`, and `IsSeparatedMap.of_comp` reads separatedness off a composite for its first factor.
Neither of those two topological statements was in Mathlib; both are added by this push, in
`Oka/Topology/SeparatedMap.lean`, whose header says what Mathlib has of that shape and why it does
not give either.

## Where each hypothesis is spent

* **`[T2Space X]`, on the base**, is spent only through
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.t2Space_left`, which is
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.t2Space_left_of_isSeparatedMap` at an object of
  this category. The category itself, its inclusion, its terminal object and the statement that
  the doubled line is not one of its objects are all stated without it.
* **Separatedness of an object** is spent three times and in three different places: on the total
  space being Hausdorff, on the underlying morphism of a morphism of this category being finite
  étale, and on `A ×_B A` being an object. The first two are
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedOver.lean`'s and are read here at objects of this category; the
  third is this file's.
* **Nothing is assumed of the base beyond `[T2Space X]`** — not connected, not non-empty — and
  nothing is assumed of a morphism beyond `CategoryTheory.Mono` where that is asked.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isSeparatedMap`: **separatedness of the underlying map, as a
  `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty`** on complex analytic spaces.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver`: **the covers of `X` separated over
  `X`**, as a category.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.toFiniteEtaleOver`: **its inclusion into
  the covers**, which is full and faithful.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.id`: **the base over itself**, and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isTerminalId`: it is terminal.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.selfProd`: **the fibre product
  `A ×_B A`, as an object of this category**, with its two projections
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.selfProdFst` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.selfProdSnd`.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.injective_base_left_of_mono`: **a
  monomorphism of this category is injective on points**, over a Hausdorff base and with no
  further hypothesis.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.inducesIsoOnDirectSummand_of_mono`: **and
  it exhibits its source as a direct summand of its target**.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.t2Space_left`: **the total space of an
  object is Hausdorff**, over a Hausdorff base.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.not_inf_isSeparatedMap_doubledLineOver`: **the line with two
  origins is not an object of this category**, so the choice is a restriction and not a renaming.

## What is not here

* **No `PreGaloisCategory` instance and no claim of one.** The field
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.inducesIsoOnDirectSummand_of_mono`
  answers to still asks `[T2Space X]` of the base, which the axiom does not; and nothing here
  bears on the other fields — base change over a general cospan of morphisms of this category,
  quotients by finite group actions, or the preservation of epimorphisms by a fibre functor.
* **The summand is produced in the covers and not inside this category.**
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.inducesIsoOnDirectSummand_of_mono`
  gives a `Z` in `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver X` and a colimit there. **The
  obstruction is that the summand is existentially quantified where it is produced**:
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.inducesIsoOnDirectSummand_of_injective`
  constructs it as the complementary clopen part at the range of the monomorphism, and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.isSeparatedMap_restrictClopenCompl` says exactly
  that object is separated over the base whenever the one it is cut out of is — but the
  existential hides which object was taken, so this file cannot reach that lemma from the
  statement. Landing the summand in this category needs the ambient statement restated with its
  witness named, and that is a push on `Oka/AnalyticSpace/DirectSummand.lean` and not on this one.
* **No coproducts and no terminal-object-and-coproducts package.**
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.isSeparatedMap_sigma` says a finite disjoint
  union of separated covers is separated, so the objects are available; what is not here is the
  cofan, the colimit, and the `CategoryTheory.Limits.HasFiniteCoproducts` instance they would
  give.
* **No `#print axioms` guards for the four instances below that carry no name.** They are the
  `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.IsStableUnderComposition`,
  `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.ContainsIdentities`,
  `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.IsMultiplicative` and
  `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.RespectsIso` instances of
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isSeparatedMap`, and
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean` declares the same four for
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale`, equally anonymous and equally unguarded. The
  guard section that carries this module says so and names them.
* **Nothing about a separated morphism that is not the structure morphism of a cover.**
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isSeparatedMap` is a property of every morphism of analytic
  spaces and the four instances are about all of them, but every statement below that mentions an
  object mentions a cover.

/-- **Separatedness of the underlying map, as a `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty`.**

`IsSeparatedMap` is `Mathlib/Topology/SeparatedMap.lean`'s and is a property of a bare function;
this reads it at the base map of a morphism of analytic spaces. It is a `def` and not an `abbrev`
for the reason `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale`'s docstring gives of itself — the
dot notation `isSeparatedMap.Over` has to resolve — and unlike that one it wraps no class, so
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isSeparatedMap_iff` below is the only unfolding lemma it needs. -/

in a position elaboration could read it from — the hypothesis names `f ≫ g` and the conclusion
names `f`, so unification sees `g` only inside the hypothesis's type, which is not enough when the
hypothesis is supplied by a tactic. This is the analytic form of a statement that asks nothing
whatever of `g`: not continuity, not injectivity, not separatedness. -/

morphisms into `X` whose base map is a separated map, and the morphisms are all the morphisms of
analytic spaces over `X`.

The property is the intersection of two morphism properties and the object condition is their
conjunction, which `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty` being a complete lattice makes literal: the
proof obligation of an object is a pair. **The second `⊤` is unchanged from
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver` and is deliberate for the same reason** — a
morphism of separated covers commutes with the two structure maps and is asked for nothing else —
and it is what makes
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.toFiniteEtaleOver` full. -/

instance search: faithful because every functor of that shape is, and full because the morphism
property is `⊤` on both sides and the implication between them is `le_rfl`. So a morphism of this
category is exactly a morphism of covers between objects of it, which is what the monomorphism
statements below turn on. -/

The proof is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.isTerminalId`'s read in this category
and it transfers unchanged, because the two categories have the same morphisms between the objects
they share: the unique morphism into it is an object's own structure map, and uniqueness is the
triangle over `X`. **Nothing here goes through
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.toFiniteEtaleOver`** — a terminal object

gives at length: that is the form a `CategoryTheory.Limits.HasTerminal` consumer asks for, and the
Galois-category definition carries this field as an instance. That docstring's argument for
declaring it an `instance` rather than leaving the witness unbundled applies here word for word
and is not repeated. -/

and an object of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver` that fails it is what says so.
Note the shape of the statement — it negates the conjunction, so it also says the pair cannot be
supplied, which is what an object of this category is. -/
