# The residue fields of a complex analytic space, and the value of a section at a point

A section of the structure sheaf of a scheme has no values in a fixed field: the residue field
varies from point to point. For a complex analytic space it does not — every residue field is
`ℂ` — and a section over `U` therefore really is a function on `U`, in the same sense in which a
section of `𝒪_{ℂ^n}` is a holomorphic function. This file constructs that function.

Precisely: for `Z` a complex analytic space and `z : Z`, the stalk `𝒪_{Z,z}` is a local
`ℂ`-algebra in which every element differs from a unique constant by an element of the maximal
ideal (`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.existsUnique_sub_stalkAlgMap_mem_maximalIdeal`). That
constant is the value, `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.evalStalk`, and composing with the germ
map gives the value of a section over an open neighbourhood,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.eval`.

## Where the statement lives, and why it is stated for `AnalyticSpace`

The ring-theoretic half is general and lives in the mirror tree, as
`IsLocalRing.IsCoefficientField` in `Oka/RingTheory/LocalRing/ResidueField/Basic.lean`: a
homomorphism from a field into a local ring realising the residue field. Everything about
uniqueness, about the induced `S →+* K`, and about transporting the property along a surjection
is proved there, of an arbitrary field and an arbitrary local ring.

What is *not* general is that the stalks of an analytic space have this property, and that is
what this file proves. It is stated for `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` rather than for a
locally ringed space with a `ℂ`-algebra structure because the proof is the existence of a chart:
there is no weaker hypothesis on a locally ringed space under which it is true. The intermediate
results are stated at the level of generality at which they hold — `LocalOkaRing ι`, then a
stalk of `𝒪_{ℂ^ι}`, then a stalk of an open subspace of `ℂ^n`, then an analytic space — each
obtained from the previous by `IsLocalRing.IsCoefficientField.of_surjective`.

## The chain of transports

`LocalOkaRing.mem_maximalIdeal_iff` says that a convergent power series is a non-unit exactly
when its constant term vanishes, which is the base case. From there:

* `okaStalkEquiv` (Taylor expansion) carries it to the stalks of `𝒪_{ℂ^ι}`;
* `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.restrictStalkIso` carries it to the stalks of an open
  subspace of `ℂ^n`;
* `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.surjective_stalkMap` carries it across a chart, this being the one
  step which is a genuine surjection rather than an isomorphism, and
  `ComplexAnalytic.IsCLinearHom.stalkAlgMap` is what makes it compatible with the constants —
  the `ℂ`-linearity of charts exists for exactly this;
* `restrictStalkIso` again carries it from the chart domain to `Z`.

Each step also carries the *value*, by `IsLocalRing.IsCoefficientField.evalHom_map`, which is
what makes `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.eval` computable rather than merely well defined; see
`ComplexAnalytic.eval_ofCutOut` and the node below.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.stalkAlgMap`: the constants, as a map `ℂ →+* 𝒪_{Z,z}`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.evalStalk`: the value at `z` of a germ.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.eval`: the value at `z` of a section over an open set
  containing `z`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.residueFieldEquiv`: the residue field at `z`, identified
  with `ℂ`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.nodeCoord`: the coordinate functions of `ℂ²`, restricted to the node.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.existsUnique_sub_stalkAlgMap_mem_maximalIdeal`: **the residue
  field of a complex analytic space at a point is `ℂ`.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.evalStalk_eq_zero_iff` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.evalStalk_ne_zero_iff_isUnit`: a germ vanishes at the point
  exactly when it lies in the maximal ideal, and is a unit exactly when it does not.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.evalStalk_eq_iff`: the value of a germ is `c` exactly when the
  germ differs from the constant `c` by one vanishing at the point. This characterises the value
  without reference to the construction, and is what a computation of a value should go through.
- `ComplexAnalytic.eval_complexAffineSpace`: on `ℂ^n` itself the value of a global section is
  its value as a holomorphic function.
- `ComplexAnalytic.eval_restrict_complexAffineSpace`: the same on an **open** subspace `ℂ^n|V`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.eval_ofCutOut`: on an analytic subspace of `V ⊆ ℂ^n`, the value of the
  restriction of a holomorphic function is the value of that function.
- `ComplexAnalytic.eval_nodeCoord`, `ComplexAnalytic.nodeCoord_mul` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.nodeCoord_ne_zero`: on the node, the coordinate functions take the expected
  values, and their product vanishes while neither does — so `Γ(node, 𝒪)` has zero divisors.

Stated for a morphism of the underlying locally ringed spaces together with `ℂ`-linearity rather
than for a `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom`, because that is the form the development can
currently instantiate — a closed immersion cutting out a chart is `ℂ`-linear and is a morphism
of locally ringed spaces, but is not packaged as a morphism of analytic spaces.
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.evalStalk_stalkMap_hom` is the corollary for an honest
morphism.

This is *not* an instance of `IsLocalRing.IsCoefficientField.evalHom_map`, which requires the map
to be surjective; `i.stalkMap` is not. Surjectivity is not what makes it work. Write the germ as
a constant plus an element of the maximal ideal
(`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.evalStalk_eq_iff`); the constant is carried to the constant by
`ℂ`-linearity (`ComplexAnalytic.IsCLinearHom.stalkAlgMap`), and the rest stays in the maximal
ideal because `i.stalkMap` is a **local** homomorphism, which is part of being a morphism of
locally ringed spaces. Locality does here what surjectivity does there. -/

/-- **On an open subspace `ℂ^n|V`, the value of a global section is `OkaRing.evalHom`.**

The third of this file's three computation rules, beside
`ComplexAnalytic.eval_complexAffineSpace` for `ℂ^n` itself and `ComplexAnalytic.eval_ofCutOut`
for a cut-out subspace. It is what makes a base-map computation on `ℂ^n|V` checkable by a route
other than unfolding the construction.

**It is one line, and the reason is worth stating because it is not visible from the

`constantsAlgMap n V` — `AnalyticSpace.restrict_algebraMap` gives `resAlgMap`, and

and `IsLocalRing.IsCoefficientField.evalHom` agrees on the nose with no transport.

The point of the section is indexed by `V.isOpenEmbedding.isOpenMap.functor.obj ⊤` rather than

/-- **The value of the pullback of a holomorphic function is its value upstairs.**

This is what makes the evaluation of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.eval` computable, and the
reason it deserves the name: on the analytic subspace of `V ⊆ ℂ^n` cut out by the `f j`, the
section obtained by restricting a holomorphic function `g` on `V` takes at a point the value
`g` takes there. -/

section Node

the structure sheaf of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.node`. -/

  (LocallyRingedSpace.Γ.map (nodeAmbient.{u}.zeroLocusSubspaceι nodeSection.{u}).op).hom
    (OkaRing.ofMvPolynomial _ (MvPolynomial.X j))

/-- **A coordinate function on the node takes at a point of the node the value of that
coordinate.**

This is the non-vacuity check for `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.eval`: on a space which is not
`ℂ^n`, the evaluation map is not merely well defined but computes the expected number. -/

/-- **Neither coordinate function on the node is zero.**

With `ComplexAnalytic.nodeCoord_mul` this says that the ring of global sections of the node has
zero divisors: the node is reducible, being the union of the two axes. The point exhibited is
the one with `j`-th coordinate `1` and the other coordinate `0`, which lies on the node. -/
