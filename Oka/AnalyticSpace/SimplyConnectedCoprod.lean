# The coproduct form of the criterion, and the index type is never counted

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimplyConnected.lean` proves that a trivial fundamental group makes **every**
cover separated over the base a finite coproduct of copies of the base over itself
(`…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.exists_iso_coprod_id`), and
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimplyConnectedCriterion.lean` makes the *connected-cover* form of that
statement a criterion. **This file is the coproduct form run backwards**, which neither of them
has: from every cover being such a coproduct to the group being trivial, and so to a second
criterion whose right-hand side mentions no connectedness at all.

## Which condition each criterion asks of a consumer

The two `Iff`s differ in their right-hand side and in nothing else.

* `…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.subsingleton_fundamentalGroup_iff` asks for an isomorphism
  `A ≅ …SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.id X` **for every `A` carrying
  `CategoryTheory.PreGaloisCategory.IsConnected`**, and so a consumer has to produce that instance
  before the condition is even stated at an object.
* `…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.subsingleton_fundamentalGroup_coprod_iff` below asks for a finite
  index type and an isomorphism with a coproduct **for every `A` whatever**, with no instance to
  discharge and no connected object to find.

**Neither implies the other by composition**, which is what makes this a file and not a corollary:
the first is about connected covers one at a time and the second quantifies over all of them, and
going from the second to the first is the whole of the middle theorem below.

## The prescription the sibling published for this, and why it is not what the proof needs

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimplyConnectedCriterion.lean`'s `## What is not here` priced this file, until
2026-09-20, at one statement: *what it needs and this file does not have is that a connected object
isomorphic to a finite coproduct of copies of a terminal object has a one-element index type.*
**That statement is true and is not needed, and nothing below counts the index type.** What is used
instead is that a *coprojection* is a monomorphism: `CategoryTheory.Limits.MonoCoprod.mono_ι` at
the `CategoryTheory.Limits.MonoCoprod` instance `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Galois/Basic.lean` declares
for every `CategoryTheory.GaloisCategory`, which makes
`CategoryTheory.Limits.Sigma.ι _ i ≫ e.inv` a mono into the connected object, after which
`CategoryTheory.PreGaloisCategory.IsConnected.noTrivialComponent` makes it an isomorphism outright.
The index type **is** a singleton whenever the hypothesis holds at a connected object, and that is
a consequence of the conclusion rather than a step towards it; it is not stated below because
nothing needs it.

**The retired clause is kept in that file as a dated record rather than struck**, which is this
repository's practice, and the repair there is to the prescription alone — *not here* is still true
of that file.

## The three steps, and only one of them is about coproducts

1. **The index type is non-empty.** `…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isInitialCoprodId` below says a
   coproduct over an empty index type is initial — `CategoryTheory.Limits.IsInitial.ofUniqueHom` at
   `CategoryTheory.Limits.Sigma.desc` and `CategoryTheory.Limits.Sigma.hom_ext`, **both of which
   quantify over the index type and so are discharged by `isEmptyElim` with no object of this
   repository in them** — and `CategoryTheory.PreGaloisCategory.IsConnected.notInitial` refuses
   that for a connected cover, through `CategoryTheory.Limits.IsInitial.ofIso`.
2. **The base over itself is not initial.** `…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.not_isInitial_id` below.
   `…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isTerminalFintypeFiberId` gives a terminal object of `FintypeCat`,
   its `CategoryTheory.Limits.IsTerminal.from` out of `FintypeCat.of PUnit` applied to `PUnit.unit`
   is a point of the fibre, and `CategoryTheory.PreGaloisCategory.not_initial_of_inhabited` is the
   step. **This is the only one of the five statements below with no coproduct in it.**
3. **One coprojection is enough.** Composed with the given isomorphism it is a mono into `A`, and
   (2) is the hypothesis `…IsConnected.noTrivialComponent` asks of its source.

**Step 1 is where the finiteness of the index type is used and it is used by instance search and
not by a proof step**: `CategoryTheory.Limits.MonoCoprod.mono_ι` asks for the coproduct of the
family restricted to the complement of a point of the index type, which exists here because that
complement is finite and a `CategoryTheory.GaloisCategory` has finite coproducts. Nothing below
mentions that coproduct.

## What the import costs, measured in the environment and not by a scan

This file's only `import` is `Oka.AnalyticSpace.SimplyConnectedCriterion`, which is in `import
Oka`'s closure already, so **the cost is zero and it is a run and not a diff**: at the commit this
file is cut from `import Oka` brings **5541** modules and at the commit that adds it **5542**, by a
set difference over `Lean.Environment.allImportedModuleNames`, and the one module the difference
contains is this one. **No Mathlib module enters the closure**, and in particular the
`CategoryTheory.Limits.MonoCoprod` instance used below costs nothing:
`Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Limits/MonoCoprod.lean` is already there, brought in by
`Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Galois/Basic.lean`, which `Oka/AnalyticSpace/GaloisCategory.lean` needs for
the `CategoryTheory.GaloisCategory` instance itself. The base figure is taken by elaborating the
base `Oka.lean` at this checkout, which imports 5540 modules and is one short of `import Oka` there
by the root module itself. **A marginal import cost is a figure about the importer at a commit and
is meaningless without one**, which is why both are pinned here and neither is in the present
tense.

## What the census scripts return

`scripts/DumpOkaDecls.lean` writes **5** rows at this module — the five declarations, with **no**
equation lemma, match lemma or congruence lemma — and the dump total moves **4998 → 5003**.
`scripts/DumpEnvNames.lean` moves **338274 → 338280**, which is those five declarations and this
one module and nothing else.

`scripts/guard_coverage.py` moves guards under `OkaTest/Axioms/` **2021 → 2026**, all five in
`OkaTest/Axioms/Morphisms.lean`; advertised in a `## Main results` **1517 → 1521**, in **233 →
234** files; and *in both lists* **1375 → 1379**. **`Δguards = Δ(in both) + Δ(nowhere)` closes at
`5 = 4 + 1`**, and the one is `…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isInitialCoprodId`: it is guarded and it
is advertised under `## Main definitions`, which that script does not read, so it lands in the
*guarded and advertised nowhere* row, which goes **646 → 647**. The *unguarded* row is flat at
**142, in 60 files** — this file opens no gap — *advertised from another file* is flat at **89**,
*abbreviated citations, not counted* at **30, four of them dotted**, and *backticked tokens that
resolve to nothing* at **719** with `--env-dump` given at both ends.

`scripts/check_docstring_names.py` goes **18097 → 18148** backticked names (**4406 → 4419**
distinct) and **350 → 381** elided citations (**164 → 170** distinct), with **0** unresolved at
both ends, **6** resolving under more than one namespace at both, and dotless **240 (120) → 244
(124)**.

**Both ends of every figure in this section are runs**, with the base column taken in a
`git worktree` at the base commit against dumps synthesised from the head ones by deleting this
module's five declaration rows and its six environment rows. **The worktree's own copy of
`scripts/guard_coverage.py` is what has to be run there**: that script sets its repository root
from `os.path.abspath(__file__)`, so invoking the *head* checkout's copy with the worktree as the
working directory reads the head's guard files and silently reports the head's guard count while
reporting the base's advertised count — a base column that is neither commit's.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isInitialCoprodId`: **a coproduct of
  copies of the base over itself, over an empty index type, is initial.**

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.not_isInitial_id`: **the base over itself
  is not an initial object.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.nonempty_iso_id_of_iso_coprod_id`: **a
  connected cover isomorphic to a finite coproduct of copies of the base over itself is isomorphic
  to the base over itself.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.subsingleton_fundamentalGroup_of_coprod`:
  **a base over which every cover is a finite coproduct of copies of the base over itself has
  trivial fundamental group**, at every point of it.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.subsingleton_fundamentalGroup_coprod_iff`:
  **and that is a criterion** — the two conditions are equivalent.

## Why one name below is shorter than its sibling's, and the constraint is the column limit

`…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.subsingleton_fundamentalGroup_of_coprod` is the name the sibling's
`…subsingleton_fundamentalGroup_of_iso_id` would suggest spelling `…_of_iso_coprod_id`, and that
spelling is **unwritable in a `## Main results` list**: `scripts/guard_coverage.py` reads a
backticked token with `` `([^`\s]+)` ``, so a name broken across two lines is not a token at all
and resolves to nothing, and the whole name plus the list's `- ` and `:` is 106 columns against a
limit of 100. **Fifty-five of those columns are the namespace**
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.`, which leaves forty for the head;
`…_of_coprod` is thirty-nine and `…_coprod_iff` is forty exactly.
The list below is written in full for the reason the sibling's heading gives, and this is the other
half of that constraint: an elided head resolves to nothing, and so does a wrapped one.

## What is not here

* **No base is exhibited whose fundamental group is trivial, and none is claimed to exist.** That
  is the first bullet of both siblings' `## What is not here` and this file does not move it; what
  it changes is the shape of hypothesis that suffices and not whether any base satisfies one.
* **No count of the index type.** Nothing below says that the `ι` of the hypothesis is a singleton,
  a subsingleton or non-empty in any statement's conclusion; the non-emptiness is a step inside one
  proof and is not named. **A consumer wanting the count has to state and prove it**, and the
  section above says why the criterion does not.
* **Nothing is said about a coproduct over a non-empty index type that is not a singleton.** The
  criterion's hypothesis is satisfied by every `A` at once, so no statement below is about a
  particular decomposition, and the `∐` in it is never taken apart except at one coprojection.
* **No transport between points.** `…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.subsingleton_fundamentalGroup_congr`
  is the sibling's and applies to the left-hand side of this criterion unchanged, that being the
  same proposition; nothing is restated here.
* **Nothing about the topologist's fundamental group, nothing about analytification and nothing
  about a scheme.** This is the analytic side alone, for the reasons the two siblings give.

`CategoryTheory.Limits.MonoCoprod.mono_ι`, at the `CategoryTheory.Limits.MonoCoprod` instance every

**The index type is never counted**, and the sibling module's `## What is not here` says why that
is worth pointing out.

**The conclusion is `Nonempty` of an isomorphism rather than the isomorphism**, matching
`…SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.nonempty_iso_id`, whose place in the next proof this takes: the
isomorphism produced is `CategoryTheory.asIso` of a morphism that depends on a choice of point of
the index type, and forgetting it is what makes the statement a proposition. -/
