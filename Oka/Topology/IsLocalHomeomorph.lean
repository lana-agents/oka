# The sheets of a map, base change of a local homeomorphism, and locality on the target

`IsLocalHomeomorph f` says that every point of the source has *some* neighbourhood on which `f`
restricts to an open embedding. What a construction indexed by opens needs instead is the family
of all such opens together with the statement that it covers, and that is what is here:
`sheetOpens f` is the set of opens on which `f` is an open embedding, and
`IsLocalHomeomorph.sSup_sheetOpens` says its supremum is `⊤`.

**And the class is stable under base change**: `IsLocalHomeomorph.pullback_snd` carries it along an
arbitrary continuous map, at Mathlib's set-level fibre product `Function.Pullback`. The two
statements are independent of each other and share only their destination.

**And it is local on the target**:
`TopologicalSpace.IsOpenCover.isLocalHomeomorph_iff_restrictPreimage` says a continuous map is a
local homeomorphism exactly when its restriction over each member of an open cover of the target
is one. `Mathlib/Topology/LocalAtTarget.lean`'s module docstring enumerates seven properties of a
continuous map as local at the target and `IsLocalHomeomorph` is not one of them — `grep -n
'IsLocalHomeomorph'` over that file returns nothing at `v4.32.0`, so it is absent from that file's
declarations too — which is why the statement is here.

**The heading above read *The sheets of a map, as a family of opens* and the paragraph under it
ended at `IsLocalHomeomorph.sSup_sheetOpens` says its supremum is `⊤`, until 2026-09-14**, when the
base-change statement was appended. The heading is broadened rather than replaced: what it named is
still here.

**And it read *The sheets of a map as a family of opens, and base change of a local homeomorphism*
until 2026-09-14**, when the local-at-target statements were appended. Broadened again and again
not replaced; *as a family of opens* is dropped from the heading alone and the `## Main
definitions` entry it describes is untouched.

There is no analytic content here, so this file is a candidate for upstreaming; it lives in the
`Oka/Topology/` mirror of the Mathlib directory tree for that reason. Upstreaming to
`Mathlib/Topology/IsLocalHomeomorph.lean` costs that file **one** new import,
`Mathlib.Topology.Sets.OpenCover`, against a closure of 649 Mathlib modules that already contains
`Mathlib.Topology.Sets.Opens`, measured with
`python3 scripts/import_cost.py --target Mathlib.Topology.IsLocalHomeomorph`.

**That sentence read `costs that file **no** new imports` until 2026-09-14**, which was exact while
this file held the sheet material and the base change: `TopologicalSpace.IsOpenCover` is
`Mathlib.Topology.Sets.OpenCover`'s and neither of those needed it. **The 649 is unmoved and is not
what changed.**

## Where the local-at-target statement belongs, priced both ways

`Mathlib/Topology/LocalAtTarget.lean` is where the statements of this shape live. **Two different
figures count them and this file uses both, so they are told apart here rather than left to
collide.** Its module docstring enumerates **seven** properties as local at the target, and that is
the figure quoted above; `TopologicalSpace.IsOpenCover` in that file states **nine**
`…_iff_restrictPreimage` theorems at `v4.32.0`, which is the declaration count. **The two in the
gap are `isHomeomorph_iff_restrictPreimage` and `denseRange_iff_restrictPreimage`** — each a
theorem with no entry in the list — and `IsLocalHomeomorph` is in neither figure, which is what
matters here and is true of both.

It is **not** where this statement is put, and the reason is measured: that file's closure is 644
Mathlib modules and adding `Mathlib.Topology.IsLocalHomeomorph` to it costs **nine** — that module,
the five `Mathlib.Topology.OpenPartialHomeomorph.*`, `Mathlib.Topology.PartialHomeomorph.Defs`,
`Mathlib.Logic.Equiv.PartialEquiv` and `Mathlib.Topology.SeparatedMap` — against **one** in the
direction taken here. **The nine modules and the nine theorems are unrelated figures that happen to
agree**, which is said because nothing else in this file would stop a reader joining them.

**Mathlib settles it the same way for the neighbouring class.** `IsCoveringMap.restrictPreimage` is
a local-at-target statement and lives in `Mathlib/Topology/Covering/Basic.lean`, its property's own
file, and not in `Mathlib/Topology/LocalAtTarget.lean`. A Mathlib reviewer who prefers the other
home is disagreeing with a nine-module import and not with the statement.

## Why the `Opens` form rather than Mathlib's

`isLocalHomeomorph_iff_isOpenEmbedding_restrict` gives, for each `x`, some `U ∈ 𝓝 x` with
`IsOpenEmbedding (U.restrict f)`. A neighbourhood is not an open, and a consumer that glues over
a cover — `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.sheetIso` is the one this was written for — needs
opens and needs them as a *family with a supremum*, not one at a time. Passing through the
source of the `OpenPartialHomeomorph` that `IsLocalHomeomorph` unfolds to, which is open by
`OpenPartialHomeomorph.open_source`, avoids taking an interior and the proof that restricting an
open embedding to a smaller open is again one.

## Main definitions

- `sheetOpens`: the opens of the source on which the map is an open embedding.

## Main results

- `IsLocalHomeomorph.exists_mem_sheetOpens`: **every point lies in a sheet.**
- `IsLocalHomeomorph.sSup_sheetOpens`: **the sheets cover**, `sSup (sheetOpens f) = ⊤`.
- `IsLocalHomeomorph.pullback_snd`: **a local homeomorphism stays a local homeomorphism under base
  change along a continuous map.**
- `IsLocalHomeomorph.restrictPreimage_of_isOpen`: **a local homeomorphism restricted over an open
  subset of its target is one.**
- `TopologicalSpace.IsOpenCover.isLocalHomeomorph_of_restrictPreimage` and
  `TopologicalSpace.IsOpenCover.isLocalHomeomorph_iff_restrictPreimage`: **being a local
  homeomorphism is local on the target.**

## What is not here

* **Nothing about the fibres.** `sheetOpens f` is a set of opens and says nothing about how many
  of them meet a fibre; finiteness of the fibres is a separate hypothesis everywhere it is needed.
* **No sheet is distinguished and no choice is made.** `IsLocalHomeomorph.exists_mem_sheetOpens`
  is an existence statement; a consumer that wants one sheet per point chooses it itself.
* **No converse.** A map whose sheets cover *is* a local homeomorphism, by
  `isLocalHomeomorph_iff_isOpenEmbedding_restrict` and `Opens.isOpen`, but nothing below needs
  that direction and it is not stated.
* **Nothing about the sheets of a base change or of a restriction.**
  `IsLocalHomeomorph.pullback_snd` is stated through
  `isLocalHomeomorph_iff_isOpenEmbedding_restrict` and says nothing about how `sheetOpens` of the
  projection relates to `sheetOpens` of the map being base-changed, and the local-at-target
  statements say nothing about `sheetOpens` either; no part of this file meets another.

  **The last clause read *the two halves of this file do not meet* until 2026-09-14**, when a third
  part was appended and *two halves* stopped naming the file. Nothing about the base change is
  retired by it: the relation it denies between `sheetOpens` and `IsLocalHomeomorph.pullback_snd`
  is the same relation and is still not stated.
* **Nothing about a restriction over an arbitrary subset of the target.**
  `IsLocalHomeomorph.restrictPreimage_of_isOpen` asks its subset to be open and spends that
  hypothesis twice, once at each subtype inclusion. **The statement without it is true and is
  `IsLocalHomeomorph.pullback_snd` in disguise** — the subspace `f ⁻¹' s` is the base change of `f`
  along `s ↪ Y` — but reading it off that theorem needs a carrier identification between
  `Function.Pullback f Subtype.val` and `f ⁻¹' s` that nothing here writes, so the open case is
  proved directly instead. **Neither statement is derived from the other in this file.**
* **Nothing about `IsCoveringMap` at the target.** Mathlib's `IsCoveringMap.restrictPreimage`
  covers the forward direction for that class over an arbitrary subset, and the descent direction
  for it is a different statement about evenly-covered neighbourhoods that nothing here touches.
* **Nothing about the other three statements under `Oka/` whose conclusion is about
  `Function.Pullback.snd`.** A covering map base-changes by `IsCoveringMap.pullback_snd` and the
  fibres stay finite by `Function.Pullback.finite_fiber_snd` — both in
  `Oka/Topology/Covering/Basic.lean` — and a proper map stays proper by `IsProperMap.pullback_snd`
  in `Oka/Topology/Maps/Proper/Basic.lean`. **This file imports neither of those two modules and
  neither imports it**, each mirroring the Mathlib module its own statement belongs in.

/-- **A local homeomorphism restricted over an open subset of its target is a local
homeomorphism.**

`Subtype.val ∘ (s.restrictPreimage g) = g ∘ Subtype.val` holds by `rfl` — the two sides are the
same function of a point of `g ⁻¹' s`, read once in `s` and once in `β` — so the right-hand side
being a local homeomorphism is the hypothesis `IsLocalHomeomorph.of_comp` wants, and the left
factor it peels off is `Subtype.val` out of the open `s`.

**`s` is asked to be open and the hypothesis is not idle**: it is spent twice, once so that
`Subtype.val` out of `g ⁻¹' s` is an open embedding and once so that `Subtype.val` out of `s` is.
The statement without it is true and is `IsLocalHomeomorph.pullback_snd` in disguise, the subspace
`f ⁻¹' s` being the base change of `f` along `s ↪ β`; it is not derived from it here, because that
needs a carrier identification this file does not write. See this file's `## What is not here`. -/

/-- **Being a local homeomorphism descends along an open cover of the target.**

`IsLocalHomeomorphOn` is a condition at each point of a set, so the conclusion is assembled one
point at a time: a point `x` has `g x` in some member `U i` of the cover, and what has to be
produced there is `IsLocalHomeomorphOn g (g ⁻¹' U i)`.

**The whole proof is `IsLocalHomeomorphOn.of_comp_right`.** The composite
`Subtype.val ∘ (U i).restrictPreimage g` is a local homeomorphism, being one open-subtype
inclusion after the hypothesis, and it is `g ∘ Subtype.val` by `rfl`; `of_comp_right` cancels the
right factor `Subtype.val` and returns the conclusion on its image, which `Subtype.range_coe`
identifies with `g ⁻¹' U i`.

**`Continuous g` is a hypothesis and it cannot be dropped.** Nothing else makes `g ⁻¹' U i` open,
and without that `Subtype.val` out of it is an embedding and not an open one. Mathlib's
`TopologicalSpace.IsOpenCover.isInducing_iff_restrictPreimage` and
`…isEmbedding_iff_restrictPreimage` carry the same hypothesis for the same reason, while
`…isClosedMap_iff_restrictPreimage` does not, because a closed map is not asked to be continuous
in the first place. A caller holding a morphism of spaces has the continuity for nothing. -/
