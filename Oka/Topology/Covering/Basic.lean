# Covering maps: a criterion and its converse, a cancellation, constant fibres, and a base change

Material for `Mathlib/Topology/Covering/Basic.lean`; see `README.md` on the mirror tree. The
statements below are independent of one another, sharing only their destination.

**Until 2026-09-07 the heading above read *Four statements about covering maps: two criteria, a
cancellation, and constancy of the fibre*, and the sentence beside it read *Four independent
statements, sharing only their destination*.** The section appended below moves whichever set
those two numerals were of, so they are replaced by the enumeration rather than raised by one: a
count of a file's own contents goes false on the next append and an enumeration does not.

## A closed local homeomorphism with finite fibres is a covering map

Mathlib proves this for `IsCoveringMapOn` — `IsClosedMap.isCoveringMapOn_of_isLocalHomeomorphOn`,
which takes a set `s`, finiteness of the fibres over `s`, and a local homeomorphism on `f ⁻¹' s`.
The statement below is that theorem at `s = Set.univ`, packaged as `IsCoveringMap`; Mathlib has
the relative form and not this one. The companion global statement it does have,
`isLocalHomeomorph_iff_isCoveringMap`, assumes the source **compact** instead of the map closed,
and is therefore not applicable to a non-compact source such as the punctured line.

The Hausdorff hypothesis on the source is Mathlib's and is used to separate the finitely many
points of a fibre; it is not removable, and
`LineTwoOrigins.not_isCoveringMap_fold_of_not_t2Space` (`OkaTest/FiniteEtaleCancel.lean`) is a
compiled witness that it is not. It is the line with two origins folded onto `ℝ`: a closed local
homeomorphism with finite fibres onto a Hausdorff space, which is every hypothesis of
`IsClosedMap.isCoveringMap_of_isLocalHomeomorph` except the separation axiom, and not a covering
map. The route to that last conjunct is `IsCoveringMap.isSeparatedMap`, which is Mathlib's, and
`IsSeparatedMap.t2Space` in `Oka/Topology/SeparatedMap.lean`, which is not.

**That clause ended at *it is not removable* until 2026-09-07**, asserting the non-removability
and citing nothing — where the paragraph on `IsCoveringMap.pullback_snd` cites
`TwoIndiscrete.not_isCoveringMap_pullback_snd` for its own hypothesis, and has since `24e9179`,
the push that added both. **The assertion was true and this
repair adds the citation rather than changing the claim**; the clause is retired as a dated
record because the sentence around it is rewritten, not because it was wrong.

## A covering map with finite fibres is a closed map

The converse of the criterion above, and the direction Mathlib does not have in any form: across
`Mathlib/Topology/Covering/`, `isClosedMap` occurs only inside proofs. `IsCoveringMap.isClosedMap`
below is what makes a finite covering space *finite* in the sense a morphism of complex analytic
spaces is asked to be: it supplies the closed base map that
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFinite` asks for and that finite fibres do not give.

**That half is what it is the only input for, and not the construction.**
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/CoveringSpace.lean` takes its cover from `IsLocalHomeomorph.sSup_sheetOpens` in
`Oka/Topology/IsLocalHomeomorph.lean`, which Mathlib also does not have, and more of this mirror
tree reaches it through the inverse image sheaf — `TopCat.Presheaf.stalkPushforward_naturality` in
`Oka/Topology/Sheaves/Stalks.lean` is used to prove the stalk isomorphism that construction's local
isomorphism rests on. No number is given here because it is not one this file could keep true.

The proof reads the evenly covered neighbourhood as what the definition literally is — an open
`U ∋ x`, and a homeomorphism `H : f ⁻¹' U ≃ₜ U × I` over `U` — and pushes the closed set across
it. Given `C` closed and `x ∉ f '' C`, the image `H '' C` is closed in `U × I`, and it misses the
slice `{x} × I` because a point of that slice lies over `x`. So each of the finitely many `i : I`
gives an open set of `U` around `x` avoiding the `i`-th sheet of `C`, and their intersection is
the neighbourhood wanted.

**Finiteness of the fibre is used once, for that intersection to be open**, and it is used at the
index type `I = f ⁻¹' {x}`, which is why the hypothesis is about fibres and not about `E`. **No
separation axiom is used at all** — unlike the criterion above, whose `T2Space E` is Mathlib's and
is not removable. And **the empty fibre is not a special case**: the intersection over an empty
index type is `U` itself, which is the right answer, since `f ⁻¹' U` is then empty and `U` misses
`f '' C` outright.

## Closedness cancels along a covering map, with no separation axiom

`IsCoveringMap.isClosedMap_of_comp`: if `f` is a covering map and `f ∘ u` is closed then `u` is
closed, for a `u` asked only to be continuous. **Mathlib has no cancellation lemma for
`IsCoveringMap` at all** — `comp_homeomorph` and `homeomorph_comp` conjugate by a homeomorphism,
and there is no composition lemma either.

The classical statement of this shape asks the second map to be **separated** and factors the
first through its graph in a fibre product. Neither is used below. A covering map instead
decomposes `f ⁻¹' U` over an evenly covered `U` into open sheets, and **`f` is injective on each
one**; that injectivity is the whole content, and the rest of the proof is that a sheet is open
with open complement in `f ⁻¹' U`, so that a closed set of the source stays closed after being cut
down to one sheet.

**What earns this its place is the separation axiom it does not ask for, and it is worth being
exact about what that is worth.** Mathlib's three cancellations for proper maps are in
`Mathlib/Topology/Maps/Proper/Basic.lean` and none of them applies: two ask the composite's second
factor to be injective or its first to be surjective, and the third, `isProperMap_of_comp_of_t2`,
asks the **middle space to be Hausdorff**. Where a Hausdorff middle space is available that third
one is both shorter and more general than this — it asks nothing whatever of the second map —
and it is what `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Finite.lean` uses for the analytic statement of this shape.
`IsCoveringMap.isClosedMap_of_comp` is what is left when no separation axiom is available at all,
and Mathlib has nothing there, not even at `IsSeparatedMap`, which a covering map satisfies.

**Nothing in this repository consumes it**, and that is said rather than left to be discovered: it
is mirror-tree material stated for its own sake, in a file whose other statements about closedness
and covering maps are its natural neighbours.

## The fibres of a covering map over a preconnected base

`IsCoveringMap.nonempty_homeomorph_fiber`: over a preconnected base any two fibres of a covering
map are homeomorphic. This is what connectedness of the base buys — the *number of sheets* — and
it is the statement that a covering map itself does not give: `IsCoveringMap` says every point has
an evenly covered neighbourhood, with the fibre over that point as the index type, and says
nothing at all relating the index types at two different points.

The argument is the usual clopen one and the whole of its content is **local constancy**, which in
turn rests on one observation Mathlib does not state:

**`IsEvenlyCovered f x I` mentions `x` only through `x ∈ U`.** Unfolded it is a `U`, its openness,
the openness of `f ⁻¹' U`, a homeomorphism `f ⁻¹' U ≃ₜ U × I` and a compatibility, and none of the
last four depends on `x`. So the *same witness* serves every point of `U`, which is
`IsEvenlyCovered.eventually`. Everything below is that fact plus `IsEvenlyCovered.fiberHomeomorph`,
which is Mathlib's.

Two details of the clopen step are worth stating because each cost a failed attempt:

* **both** halves are the same local-constancy fact. `Sᶜ` is open because `Nonempty (· ≃ₜ ·)` is
  symmetric and transitive, not by a second argument;
* `IsClosed S` is the structure constructor applied to openness of the complement,
  `⟨hclosed⟩`. `isClosed_compl_iff` is about `IsClosed Sᶜ` and is the wrong lemma here.

**`PreconnectedSpace`, not `ConnectedSpace`.** Nonemptiness of the base plays no part, and asking
for it would make the statement fail on the empty space for no reason.

## A covering map stays one under base change along a continuous map

`Function.Pullback f g` is Mathlib's set-theoretic fibre product (`Mathlib/Data/Set/Prod.lean`), a
subtype of `E × Y`, so it carries the subspace topology of the product and
`IsCoveringMap.pullback_snd` constructs no type and no instance: it is a statement about
`Function.Pullback.snd` at the topology that is already there.

Being evenly covered is a condition on the base and the witness transports unchanged. Over an open
`U ∋ g y` with `H : f ⁻¹' U ≃ₜ U × I`, the set `g ⁻¹' U` is an open neighbourhood of `y`, and the
part of the pullback lying over it goes to `(g ⁻¹' U) × I` by `(e, y') ↦ (y', (H e).2)`. **The index
type is the same `I`**, which is what leaves the fibre of the base change one application of
`IsEvenlyCovered.to_isEvenlyCovered_preimage` away and what makes the companion statement about
fibres independent of the trivialisation.

**`Continuous g` is a hypothesis of `IsCoveringMap.pullback_snd` and it cannot be dropped.** The
underlying map of sets needs nothing — that is why `Function.Pullback.finite_fiber_snd` below asks
for no topology at all — but `g ⁻¹' U` being open is what makes the trivialisation above a
trivialisation, and the conclusion is false without it:
`TwoIndiscrete.not_isCoveringMap_pullback_snd` (`OkaTest/CoveringBaseChange.lean`) compiles a
witness, at the identity of a two-element discrete space base-changed along the identity out of the
same two points carrying the indiscrete topology, where `Function.Pullback.snd` is a continuous
bijection and not an open map.

`Function.Pullback.finite_fiber_snd` is the fibre half and carries neither a covering hypothesis
nor a topology: `Function.Pullback.fst` is injective on the fibre of `Function.Pullback.snd` over
`y` and lands it inside `f ⁻¹' {g y}`. It is stated apart from `IsCoveringMap.pullback_snd` rather
than conjoined with it because `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_coveringSpaceHom`
(`Oka/AnalyticSpace/CoveringSpace.lean`) asks for a covering map and for finite fibres as two
hypotheses.

**Both are statements about continuous maps of topological spaces, and the word *topological* is
doing work in that sentence.** The `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_coveringSpaceHom` just
cited reads a covering map of underlying spaces as a finiteness statement about a morphism of
complex analytic spaces, and neither statement below is composed with it in this file. Both are
guarded in `OkaTest/Axioms/Morphisms.lean` rather than beside a consumer, which is where
`IsCoveringMap.isClosedMap_of_comp` is guarded and for the reason that section gives; what consumes
`Function.Pullback.finite_fiber_snd` at the commit that adds it is
`TwoIndiscrete.not_isCoveringMap_pullback_snd_of_not_continuous`, a declaration of a test file,
which the guards of this repository's library do not reach.

## Main results

- `IsClosedMap.isCoveringMap_of_isLocalHomeomorph`: a closed local homeomorphism with finite
  fibres out of a Hausdorff space is a covering map.
- `IsCoveringMap.isClosedMap`: **a covering map with finite fibres is closed**, which is the
  converse of the previous item with the Hausdorff hypothesis dropped.
- `IsCoveringMap.isClosedMap_of_comp`: **closedness cancels along a covering map** — if `f` is a
  covering map and `f ∘ u` is closed then so is `u`, with no hypothesis on `u` beyond continuity
  and no separation axiom anywhere.
- `IsEvenlyCovered.eventually`: an evenly covered point is evenly covered on a neighbourhood, with
  the same index type.
- `IsCoveringMap.eventually_nonempty_homeomorph`: the fibres of a covering map are locally
  constant up to homeomorphism.
- `IsCoveringMap.nonempty_homeomorph_fiber`: **over a preconnected base, any two fibres of a
  covering map are homeomorphic.**
- `IsCoveringMap.pullback_snd`: **a covering map stays a covering map under base change along a
  continuous map**, at Mathlib's `Function.Pullback`.
- `Function.Pullback.finite_fiber_snd`: the fibres of `Function.Pullback.snd` are finite when the
  fibres of the map being base-changed are, with no covering hypothesis and no topology.

/-- **A closed local homeomorphism with finite fibres out of a Hausdorff space is a covering
map.**

This is `IsClosedMap.isCoveringMapOn_of_isLocalHomeomorphOn` at `Set.univ`. No connectedness of
the target is needed: a point outside the range is evenly covered by the empty index type, which
is how that proof treats it.

**`[T2Space E]` cannot be dropped**, and the witness is
`LineTwoOrigins.not_isCoveringMap_fold_of_not_t2Space` (`OkaTest/FiniteEtaleCancel.lean`): the
line with two origins folded onto `ℝ` is closed, has finite fibres and is a local homeomorphism —
`hf`, `hfin` and `h` here — onto a Hausdorff target, and is not a covering map. **The separation
axiom is on the *source* and there is none on the target beyond what the witness happens to
have** — `ℝ` is Hausdorff there because
that is the space the witness is built over, not because this statement asks it. -/

/-- **A covering map with finite fibres is a closed map.**

The converse of `IsClosedMap.isCoveringMap_of_isLocalHomeomorph`, with the Hausdorff hypothesis
dropped: nothing below separates two points of a fibre, it only counts them.

Given a closed `C` and a point `x` outside `f '' C`, the evenly covered neighbourhood of `x` is an
open `U` and a homeomorphism `H : f ⁻¹' U ≃ₜ U × (f ⁻¹' {x})` over `U`. The image of `C` under `H`
is closed, and misses every point of the slice over `x`, because such a point is a preimage of `x`
and `x ∉ f '' C`. Intersecting the finitely many slices of the complement gives the neighbourhood.

**Finiteness of the fibre is used exactly once**, for that intersection to be open; the empty
fibre is not a special case, since the empty intersection is `U`, which is then disjoint from
`f '' C` because `f ⁻¹' U` is empty. -/

/-- **Closedness cancels along a covering map**: if `f` is a covering map and `f ∘ u` is a closed
map, then `u` is closed.

Nothing is asked of `u` beyond continuity — not that it be closed, injective, surjective or a local
homeomorphism — and **no separation axiom is used**, on any of the three spaces.

The classical statement of this shape is *a map whose composite with a separated map is proper is
proper*, proved by factoring `u` through its graph in a fibre product. **Neither ingredient is used
here.** What a covering map supplies instead is a *sheet*: for `y : E` there is an evenly covered
`U ∋ f y` and a decomposition of `f ⁻¹' U` into open pieces on each of which `f` is injective. The
proof is that decomposition and nothing else:

* the sheet `V ∋ y` and the union `V'` of the other sheets are **both open**, because the sheet
  index is `Prod.snd ∘ H` into a discrete type, so `A := C ∩ u ⁻¹' V` is closed *in*
  `u ⁻¹' (f ⁻¹' U)` — which is what `hAcl` says, and is where `V'` is used;
* therefore `closure A` is a closed set on which the hypothesis can be spent, and
  `T := (f ∘ u) '' closure A` is closed;
* `f y ∉ T`: a witness would lie in `A` by the previous point, so its image under `u` lies in `V`
  alongside `y` and has the same image under `f`, and **`f` is injective on `V`** — so it *is* `y`,
  contradicting `y ∉ u '' C`;
* `V ∩ f ⁻¹' Tᶜ` is then an open neighbourhood of `y` missing `u '' C`.

**Injectivity on a sheet is the whole of what the hypothesis buys**, and it is what fails for a
closed local homeomorphism with finite fibres that is not a covering map — the line with two
origins over the line, whose two origins have no disjoint neighbourhoods and hence no sheet
containing exactly one of them. `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Finite.lean` records that example as the reason
this statement is false with `IsCoveringMap f` weakened to *`f` closed with finite fibres*, and
`TwoIndiscrete.not_isClosedMap_pt_of_isClosedMap_comp` (`OkaTest/FiniteEtaleCancel.lean`)
compiles a witness for the weakening — a weaker one, since its second map is not a local
homeomorphism.

**Note what those two witnesses have in common besides failing to be covering maps: their `E` is
not Hausdorff.** That is not an accident, and it means this lemma is *not* the cheapest route to
any statement in which `E` is known to be Hausdorff. There `isProperMap_of_comp_of_t2` applies —
Mathlib's proper-map cancellation, whose separation hypothesis is on `E` and which asks nothing at
all of the first map — and it is both shorter and more general. This lemma is what remains when no
separation axiom is available, which is the case Mathlib does not cover, at `IsCoveringMap` or at
`IsSeparatedMap`; `IsCoveringMap.comp_homeomorph` and `IsCoveringMap.homeomorph_comp` are
conjugation by a homeomorphism and there is no composition lemma either.

**Nothing in this repository consumes this**; see the module docstring. -/

/-- **An evenly covered point is evenly covered on a whole neighbourhood, with the same index

`IsEvenlyCovered f x I` is a `U` containing `x` together with data over `U` — its openness, the
openness of `f ⁻¹' U`, a homeomorphism `f ⁻¹' U ≃ₜ U × I` and its compatibility with `f` — and
**`x` occurs in none of that data except through `x ∈ U`.** So the witness for `x` is verbatim a
witness for every `y ∈ U`, and the proof destructures it and puts it back together.

Note that the index type is the *same* `I`, which is what makes this usable: applied to
`IsCoveringMap f` at `x`, whose index type is `f ⁻¹' {x}`, it says every nearby point has fibre
`f ⁻¹' {x}` — not merely that every nearby point is evenly covered by something.

Mathlib does not have this; it sits with `IsEvenlyCovered.of_fiber_homeomorph`. -/

The conclusion is `Nonempty (… ≃ₜ …)` rather than a homeomorphism, because there is no canonical
choice: the identification depends on the evenly covered neighbourhood, and a different one gives
a different homeomorphism. Nothing below needs a canonical one. -/

This is what connectedness of the base is for, and `IsCoveringMap` on its own does not give it:
being evenly covered relates the points *near* `x` to `x`, and nothing in the definition relates
two points that are far apart.

The proof is the clopen argument on `S = {z | Nonempty ((f ⁻¹' {z}) ≃ₜ (f ⁻¹' {x}))}`. Both halves
are `IsCoveringMap.eventually_nonempty_homeomorph` and nothing else — `Sᶜ` is open because
`Nonempty (· ≃ₜ ·)` is symmetric and transitive, so a point near a point *not* in `S` cannot be in
`S` either. `S` is nonempty because `x ∈ S` by `Homeomorph.refl`.

`PreconnectedSpace` and not `ConnectedSpace`: the base being nonempty is never used, and over the
empty space the statement is vacuous rather than false. -/

/-- **A covering map stays a covering map under base change along a continuous map.**

`Function.Pullback f g` is Mathlib's set-theoretic fibre product, a subtype of `E × Y`; the
topology on it is the subspace topology of the product, so nothing is constructed here beyond the
trivialisation itself.

Being evenly covered is a condition on the base and the witness for `g y` transports to `y`
unchanged: over an open `U ∋ g y` with `H : f ⁻¹' U ≃ₜ U × I`, the set `g ⁻¹' U` is an open
neighbourhood of `y`, and the part of the pullback lying over it goes to `(g ⁻¹' U) × I` by
`(e, y') ↦ (y', (H e).2)`. **The index type is the same `I`**, so
`IsEvenlyCovered.to_isEvenlyCovered_preimage` is all that is left to do.

**`Continuous g` cannot be dropped.** It is used once, for `g ⁻¹' U` to be open, and that one use
is not removable: `TwoIndiscrete.not_isCoveringMap_pullback_snd` (`OkaTest/CoveringBaseChange.lean`)
compiles a witness with `f` the identity of a two-element discrete space and `g` the identity out of
the same two points carrying the indiscrete topology, where `Function.Pullback.snd` is a continuous
bijection and not an open map. -/

`Function.Pullback.fst` sends the fibre of `Function.Pullback.snd` over `y` into `f ⁻¹' {g y}`, and
it is injective there because the second components agree by assumption. **Neither a covering
hypothesis nor a topology is used**, which is why the `TopologicalSpace` instances of this file are
omitted rather than left to be included and unused; and it is stated apart from
`IsCoveringMap.pullback_snd` because `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_coveringSpaceHom` asks
for a covering map and for finite fibres as two hypotheses rather than one. -/
