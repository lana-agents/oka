# The quotient of a covering map by a finite group acting over the base

Material for `Mathlib/Topology/Covering/Quotient.lean`; see `README.md` on the mirror tree.
**That file exists at the pinned Mathlib revision**, so the mirror path names a target to add to
and not a proposed new one, and `scripts/import_cost.py` prices the two imports above at **0**
modules against that target's closure of **1033** — both are already in it. **That measurement is
what chose the path**: the same two imports cost **68** against
`Mathlib/Topology/Covering/Basic.lean`, whose closure of **812** does not contain
`Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/ConstMulAction.lean`, and a continuous group action cannot be spoken of
without it. Nothing declared in this repository occurs below, and every statement here would make
sense to a reader who had never heard of Oka's theorem.

Let `p : E → X` be a covering map with finite fibres and let a finite group `G` act on `E` by
homeomorphisms **over `X`**. Then the induced map on the orbit space is again a covering map with
finite fibres. **The action is not assumed free**, and there is no separation axiom and no
hypothesis of any kind on `X`.

## What Mathlib has under this path, and why it is not this

`Mathlib/Topology/Covering/Quotient.lean` is about the **other** map — the quotient map
`E → E ⧸ G` — and the structure it is built around asks the action to be **free**, the blocks that
do not use that structure asking proper discontinuity and concluding on the free locus instead.
`IsQuotientCoveringMap f G` has a `disjoint`
field saying that every point has a neighbourhood whose translates by the group elements are
pairwise disjoint, `IsQuotientCoveringMap.isCancelSMul` is that file reading the freeness back off
that field, and `IsQuotientCoveringMap.isCoveringMap` concludes that `f` itself is a covering map.
Those three are one block of that file and not its remainder, and its own title says how much
wider the subject is: *Covering maps to quotients by free and properly discontinuous group
actions*. At the `v4.32.0` this repository pins — `lake-manifest.json`, rev `81a5d257` — it carries
**34 source declarations**, in six blocks: **4** the structure and its additive twin and the two
lemmas translating between them; **5** general lemmas about `IsQuotientCoveringMap`, the
`isCancelSMul` above one of them; **11** the deck action on a fibre, of which
`IsQuotientCoveringMap.mulActionFiber_isPretransitive`,
`IsQuotientCoveringMap.toPermFiber_injective` and `IsQuotientCoveringMap.exists_toPermFiber_eq`
are three; **6** under `Topology.IsQuotientMap` on the properly discontinuous route, which the next
paragraph is about; **5** on a topological group by a discrete subgroup; and **3** conclusions, the
`isCoveringMap` above one of them.

**What rules all six blocks out is one reading and not six.** In every one of the 34 the group acts
on the **source** of the map under discussion and that map's fibres are its orbits, so the quotient
is the map's **target**. The map this file is about has the quotient as its **source**: `p` is
already a covering map, `G` acts on `E` over `X`, and what descends is `E ⧸ G → X`.
**Nothing below assumes freeness, and nothing below is about `E → E ⧸ G`.**

**The nearest statement of that file to the hypotheses here is still about the other map, and
asks two things not assumed here.** `isCoveringMapOn_quotientMk_of_properlyDiscontinuousSMul`
gives that `E → E ⧸ G` is a covering map **on the image of the free locus**
`{e | MulAction.stabilizer G e = ⊥}`, and a finite action does supply its
`ProperlyDiscontinuousSMul` hypothesis, by `Finite.to_properlyDiscontinuousSMul`. But it also asks
`[LocallyCompactSpace E]` and `[T2Space E]`, neither of which is available here, and its
conclusion is about the quotient map away from the fixed points rather than about the descent.

## The mathematics, which is one shrinking step and then bookkeeping

Over an evenly covered `U ∋ x` the total space is `U × I` with `I` the fibre, discrete and here
finite. An element `g` of `G` acts over `X`, so it carries `(v, i)` to `(v, τ g (v, i))` for a
map `τ g` into `I`, continuous and therefore **locally constant in `v`**, `I` being discrete.
Intersecting the neighbourhoods on which the finitely many functions `τ g (·, i)` are constant —
finitely many because `G` is finite and the fibre is finite, **and this is the only place either
finiteness is used** — gives a smaller `V ∋ x` on which the action is by a single permutation
`act g` of `I`. Then `p ⁻¹' V` is `V × I` equivariantly, the orbit space over `V` is
`V × (I / act)`, and `I / act` is finite and discrete.

`IsEvenlyCovered.exists_smul_parametrisation` is that shrinking step and
`IsEvenlyCovered.of_smul_parametrisation` is the descent it feeds; the second **uses no finiteness
of `G` and none of the fibre**, which is why the two are separate statements rather than one
proof.

## The descended map is a hypothesis and not a construction

Every statement about the orbit space below takes the descended map `q` as a variable together
with `∀ e, q (Quotient.mk _ e) = p e`, rather than building it. Any such `q` is `Quotient.lift p`
at the proof that `p` is constant on orbits, since `Quotient.mk _` is surjective, so nothing is
lost; what is gained is that no definition is introduced for a term `Quotient.lift` already
names, and that a caller who has a descended map in hand for another reason can use these
directly. **That `p` is constant on orbits is a consequence of that hypothesis and not a further
one**, and `IsCoveringMap.of_comp_quotientMk` derives it rather than asking for it.

## Main results

- `IsCoveringMap.of_comp_quotientMk`: **the descent of a covering map with finite fibres to the
  orbit space of a finite group acting continuously over the base is a covering map**.
- `MulAction.finite_fiber_of_comp_quotientMk`: its fibres are finite, for any group.
- `IsEvenlyCovered.exists_smul_parametrisation`: the shrinking step — an evenly covered point of
  a finite fibre has an evenly covered neighbourhood on which a finite group acting over the base
  permutes the sheets by a single permutation of the fibre.
- `IsEvenlyCovered.of_smul_parametrisation`: given such a neighbourhood, the orbit space is
  evenly covered there.

## What is not here

* **Nothing about the quotient map `E → E ⧸ G`**, which is the subject of the Mathlib file this
  one is material for. Whether it is a covering map is not decided here in either direction.
* **No freeness, and no `IsQuotientCoveringMap`.** That structure is not mentioned below and
  nothing here bears on it.
* **No topology is put on `G`.** It is an abstract group acting continuously by
  `ContinuousConstSMul`, which is a statement about each `g` separately.
* **Nothing about an infinite group.** `Finite G` is a hypothesis of the shrinking step and of
  the main result, and the module docstring says where it is used; nothing below says the
  conclusion fails without it.
* **Nothing about the orbit space as a topological space in its own right** — not that it is
  Hausdorff, not that it is locally compact, not that the quotient map is closed. Only the
  evenly-covered property of the descended map is proved.
* **Nothing about a fundamental group, a deck transformation group or a Galois correspondence.**

/-- **A finite group acting over the base permutes the sheets by a single permutation, after
shrinking the base.** If `x` is evenly covered by `p` with finite fibre `I` and a finite group `G`
acts continuously on the total space over `X`, then `x` has an open neighbourhood `V` and a
parametrisation `s : V × I → E` of `p ⁻¹' V` — an open embedding onto it, over `V` — together
with an action `act` of `G` on `I` for which `g • s (v, i) = s (v, act g i)`.

**Both finiteness hypotheses are spent in one place.** Each `g` carries `(v, i)` to
`(v, τ g (v, i))` with `τ g` continuous into the discrete `I`, hence locally constant in `v`;
`V` is the intersection over `g` and `i` of the neighbourhoods of `x` on which `τ g (·, i)` is
constant, and that intersection is open because there are finitely many of them.

`act` is returned with its two action laws rather than as a `MulAction` instance, so that a
caller may install whichever setoid or instance it needs; the laws are read off the equivariance
at `x` itself, which lies in `V`. -/

/-- **A base point parametrised equivariantly is evenly covered in the orbit space.** Given a
descent `q` of `p` to the orbit space and a parametrisation `s : V × I → E` of `p ⁻¹' V` on which

evenly covered by `q`.

The fibre is `I` modulo the relation `act` generates, which is discrete because `I` is; the
homeomorphism onto `V ×` that quotient is the parametrisation followed by the quotient map, which
is continuous, bijective and open because `Prod.map id (Quotient.mk _)` is an open quotient map.
