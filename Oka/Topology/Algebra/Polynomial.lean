# The zero locus of a continuous family of monic polynomials is proper over the parameters

For a family `p : X → K[X]` of **monic** polynomials of one fixed degree whose coefficients vary
continuously, the first projection

    {(x, z) : p x evaluated at z is 0}  ⟶  X

is a proper map: it is closed and its fibres are finite. Finite because a fibre is the root set of
a nonzero polynomial; closed because the roots of a monic polynomial are bounded by its
coefficients, so the zero locus stays inside a fixed ball over a neighbourhood of any parameter,
and there the projection is closed for the reason `isClosedMap_fst_of_compactSpace` is.

Material for `Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/Polynomial.lean`, which is where
`Polynomial.isProperMap_eval` and `Polynomial.isClosedMap_eval` live — the same statements for the
map `z ↦ q.eval z` of a *single* polynomial. `Polynomial.isProperMap_eval` is a **special case**
of the results below, and that is the argument for the destination: for `q` monic of positive
degree, properness of `z ↦ q.eval z` is `Polynomial.isProperMap_fst_zeroLocus` at `X = K` and the
family `x ↦ q - C x`, transported along the graph homeomorphism `z ↦ (q.eval z, z)` onto the zero
locus of that family — and dropping monicity costs one further step, composing with
multiplication by `q.leadingCoeff`, a homeomorphism of `K`. (`Polynomial.isClosedMap_eval` is
that together with the constant case, which is `isClosedMap_const` and is not below.) Both
derivations were compiled against this file and neither is kept, because each belongs beside the
theorem it recovers rather than here. Taking `X` to be a point recovers nothing instead: the
projection is then a map into `PUnit`, and no second variable is left to exchange. See
`README.md` on the mirror tree; no statement below mentions anything defined in this repository.

## Why that destination and not the one the proof reads from

The one Mathlib input that file does not already have is `Polynomial.IsRoot.norm_lt_cauchyBound`,
from `Mathlib/Analysis/Polynomial/CauchyBound.lean`. Upstreaming to the *topology* file costs
**3** Mathlib modules on a closure of **1545** — `Mathlib.Algebra.Field.GeomSum`,
`Mathlib.Algebra.Order.Field.GeomSum` and `Mathlib.Analysis.Polynomial.CauchyBound` itself.
Upstreaming to `Mathlib/Analysis/Polynomial/CauchyBound.lean` instead, which is where the bound
comes from, costs **307** on a closure of **1241**, because that file knows nothing of topology.
Both measured with `python3 scripts/import_cost.py --target …`. **Split by destination, not by
subject**: the subject of the results below is properness, and properness is what the target file
is about.

## The nearest built thing, and what it does not cover

`Oka/Analysis/Complex/CoveringMap.lean` proves exactly this pair — closed, with finite fibres —
for `x ↦ xⁿ` on the nonzero elements of a proper normed field (`isClosedMap_npow`,
`finite_fiber_npow`). The family behind those two is `X ^ n - C w` over the punctured base,
parametrised by the *target* point `w`; it is the family `finite_fiber_npow`'s own proof writes
down, and it is **not** a constant one — a constant family `p ≡ Xⁿ` has zero locus `X × {0}` and
gives nothing. **Both statements do follow from the two halves below.** They are stated in the
disguise where the zero locus has been solved for and presented as the source of a map rather
than as a subset of a product, and undoing that disguise is again a graph homeomorphism,
`x ↦ (xⁿ, x)`; both derivations across it were compiled against this file. The two theorems are
kept where they are because a covering-map file is where they are wanted and their proofs are
self-contained, and nothing below uses them.

What does not transfer is their *proof*. Closedness there comes from `isClosedMap_pow`, which is
the properness of a single polynomial map, and no root bound appears anywhere in that file —
which is the difference: a family cannot be handled by a statement about one polynomial, and the
bound is what replaces it.

## Why the bound below rather than `Polynomial.cauchyBound`

`Polynomial.cauchyBound q` is
`Finset.sup (Finset.range q.natDegree) (‖q.coeff ·‖₊) / ‖q.leadingCoeff‖₊ + 1`, a `Finset.sup` in
`ℝ≥0` divided by a norm. What the argument needs is a bound that is visibly
*continuous in the family*, and a `Finset.sup` in `ℝ≥0` of continuous `ℝ`-valued functions is one
step of `NNReal` bookkeeping away from being that. `Polynomial.monicRootBound` replaces the
supremum by the sum and the division by nothing — the leading coefficient is `1` — so it is a
finite sum of continuous functions and `Polynomial.continuous_monicRootBound` is two lemmas.
It is weaker than Cauchy's bound and it is deduced from it; nothing here needs it to be sharp.

## Main results

- `Polynomial.IsRoot.norm_le_monicRootBound`: **the roots of a monic polynomial are bounded by the
  sum of the norms of its lower coefficients**, plus one.
- `Polynomial.continuous_eval_of_continuous_coeff`: **evaluation of a family of bounded degree is
  jointly continuous** in the parameter and the point.
- `Polynomial.isClosed_fst_image_of_monic`: **the parameters over which a closed set of roots sits
  form a closed set** — the content of properness, before any packaging.
- `Polynomial.isProperMap_fst_zeroLocus`: **the zero locus of a continuous family of monic
  polynomials of fixed degree is proper over the parameters**, together with its two halves
  `Polynomial.isClosedMap_fst_zeroLocus` and `Polynomial.finite_preimage_fst_zeroLocus`.

## What is not here

* **Nothing complex-analytic.** `K` is any normed field, proper where properness of the ball is
  used; `X` is any topological space. The intended instance is `K = ℂ` and `X` an open subset of
  `ℂ^n`, with `p` the Weierstrass polynomial of a hypersurface, but no holomorphy is used or
  stated and no declaration in this file mentions `ComplexAnalytic`; the only other occurrences of
  the namespace are the citations in the two bullets below.
* **No `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFinite`.** Turning the two halves below into finiteness of
  a morphism of analytic spaces is the second half of taxis #1109 and needs the analytic structure
  on the zero locus, which is not the subject of this file. The worked model for that assembly is
  `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_sq` in `OkaTest/FiniteMorphism.lean`: it builds `IsFinite` for `z ↦ z²`
  out of a purely topological closedness statement and a purely topological fibre statement,
  each transported across a carrier bridge — and the two it transports are `isClosedMap_npow` and
  `finite_fiber_npow`, the pair of the section above.
* **No statement about the fibre cardinality.** A fibre is finite, and it has at most `d` points
  because it is the root set of a polynomial of degree `d`; only the finiteness is proved, because
  only the finiteness is what `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFinite` asks for. The counting
  statement is `Polynomial.card_roots'` and is not specialised here.
* **No continuity of the roots.** That the root *set* moves continuously with the parameter is a
  different and harder statement; what is proved is that it stays locally bounded, which is all
  properness needs.

Weaker than `Polynomial.cauchyBound`, which uses the supremum in place of the sum, and chosen for
that: a finite sum of norms of continuously varying coefficients is continuous in the parameter
by `Polynomial.continuous_monicRootBound`, with no `NNReal` supremum in the way. -/

/-- **Evaluation of a family of polynomials of bounded degree is jointly continuous** in the

The degree bound is what makes this a *finite* sum: `Polynomial.eval_eq_sum_range'` rewrites every
member of the family as the same sum over `Finset.range (d + 1)`, whose terms are continuous
because the coefficients are. Without a uniform bound there is no such sum and the statement is
false — the coefficient functions of a family of unbounded degree can each be continuous while
the evaluation is not. -/

/-! ### Properness over the parameters -/

/-- **A closed set of roots of a continuous family of monic polynomials has closed image in the
parameters.**

This is the whole content of the properness below, stated for a set rather than for a map so that
the subtype version and the `IsProperMap` version are both two lines from it.

The argument is the generalised tube lemma over a ball that works for a whole neighbourhood of the
parameter: `Polynomial.continuous_monicRootBound` gives a neighbourhood `V` of `x₀` on which the
bound stays below a constant `M`, so over `V` every root of the family lies in the closed ball of
radius `M`, which is compact because `K` is proper. `generalized_tube_lemma` applied to `{x₀}` and
that ball separates `s` from a smaller neighbourhood, and intersecting with `V` gives a
neighbourhood of `x₀` missing the image. Monicity enters exactly once, in the bound; the degree
must be constant rather than bounded, since a family whose leading coefficient degenerates has
roots escaping to infinity. -/
