# Two missing lemmas about stalks

`TopCat.Presheaf.stalkPushforward C g F x : (g _* F).stalk (g x) ⟶ F.stalk x` is natural in `F`.
Mathlib has the definition and its compatibility with germs, identities and composites of `g`,
but not this naturality square, which is what one needs to move a morphism of presheaves on the
source space through a stalk computation on the target space.

`TopCat.Presheaf.stalkCongr F e : F.stalk x ≅ F.stalk y` for inseparable `x` and `y` likewise
has its compatibility with germs in Mathlib only as an equality of morphisms, for
`stalkSpecializes`; `TopCat.Presheaf.stalkCongr_hom_germ` is the applied form, which is what one
needs after `AlgebraicGeometry.SheafedSpace.hom_stalk_ext` puts such a transport into a goal.

There is no analytic content here, so this file is a candidate for upstreaming to Mathlib; it
lives in the `Oka/Topology/` mirror of the Mathlib directory tree for that reason.

## Main results

/-- The map on stalks induced by a pushforward is natural in the presheaf: pushing a morphism
`T : F ⟶ G` of presheaves on `X` forward along `g : X ⟶ Y` and then descending to the stalk at
`x` is the same as descending first and applying `T` on stalks. -/

/-- **The specialization map between the stalks at two points which are in fact equal is an
isomorphism.**

`TopCat.Presheaf.stalkCongr` says this for `Inseparable` points and returns an isomorphism; this
is the `IsIso` form for a specialization arising from an equality, which is the shape in which it
is needed after `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.stalkMap_congr_hom` — that lemma produces a
`stalkSpecializes` whose proof argument is manufactured from an equation between morphisms, and
one cannot name the resulting proof term in advance. -/

/-- **Transporting a germ between the stalks at two inseparable points is the germ at the other
point.**

Mathlib has `TopCat.Presheaf.germ_stalkSpecializes` as an equality of morphisms; this is the
applied form for the isomorphism `TopCat.Presheaf.stalkCongr`, which is what one needs after
`AlgebraicGeometry.SheafedSpace.hom_stalk_ext` puts a `stalkCongr` transport into the goal.

Note that the membership `hy` is an argument rather than derived from `hx`: any proof will do,
and taking it as given is what lets the caller write the germ at `y` in whatever form the
surrounding statement already produced. -/
