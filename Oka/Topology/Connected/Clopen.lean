# The connected component of a point of a disjoint union of connected spaces

`Sigma.mk i` embeds the `i`-th member of a disjoint union as a clopen subset, and a clopen
connected subset containing a point **is** that point's connected component. So if every member is
connected the components of `Σ i, β i` are exactly the members, and
`connectedComponent_sigmaMk` is that statement.

**Mathlib gets as far as the members and stops one step short of the components.**
`Mathlib/Topology/Connected/Clopen.lean` — the file this one is staged for — has
`Sigma.isConnected_iff`, *a subset of a disjoint union is connected exactly when it is the image
of a connected subset of one member*, and `Mathlib/Topology/Constructions.lean` has
`isOpen_range_sigmaMk` and `isClosed_range_sigmaMk`. **What neither says is what the connected
component of a point is**, and at `v4.32.0` no statement in Mathlib mentions `connectedComponent`
together with a disjoint union at all:
`grep -rn 'connectedComponent' Mathlib/ | grep -iE 'sigma|Sum\.|coprod'` returns **nothing**,
against **56** occurrences of `connectedComponent` in the destination file itself.

**There is no complex-analytic content here**, so this file is in the `Oka/Topology/` mirror of the
Mathlib directory tree; `README.md`'s mirror-tree section is what asks for that.
**Upstreaming to `Mathlib/Topology/Connected/Clopen.lean` costs that file nothing**:
its only import beyond the target is `Mathlib.Topology.Constructions`, which is already in that
target's closure of **614** Mathlib modules, measured with `python3 scripts/import_cost.py
--target Mathlib.Topology.Connected.Clopen Mathlib.Topology.Constructions`.
That is not an accident of this proof — the destination file already consumes `isOpenMap_sigmaMk`
and `sigma_mk_injective` from that module, in `Sigma.isConnected_iff`'s own proof.

## Main results

- `connectedComponent_sigmaMk`: **the connected component of a point of a disjoint union of
  connected spaces is the member it lies in**, as the range of `Sigma.mk` at that point's index.

## What is not here

* **No converse and no hypothesis-free version.** `[∀ i, ConnectedSpace (β i)]` is what makes the
  member equal to the component rather than merely contain it; without it the component of
  `⟨i, y⟩` is the image of the component of `y`, which is a different statement and is not
  needed by the consumer this was written for.
* **Nothing about `ConnectedComponents`**, the quotient type. The statement below is about the
  set, and a reader who wants the quotient identified with the index type would have to say what
  happens over an empty member — a member with empty carrier is excluded here by
  `ConnectedSpace`, which is why the set-level statement needs no such case.

open Set

/-- **The connected component of a point of a disjoint union of connected spaces is the member it
lies in.**

The two inclusions are the two things a clopen connected set is good for. `Set.range (Sigma.mk i)`
is clopen — `isClosed_range_sigmaMk` and `isOpen_range_sigmaMk` — and contains the point, so it
contains no more than the component by `IsClopen.connectedComponent_subset`; and it is
preconnected, being the image of the connected `β i` under `Sigma.mk i`, so it is contained in the
component by `IsPreconnected.subset_connectedComponent`.

**`[∀ i, ConnectedSpace (β i)]` is used in the second inclusion only**, and only through
`isPreconnected_univ`: the first holds for any family whatever. -/
