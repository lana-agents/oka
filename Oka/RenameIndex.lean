# Relabelling the variables of a germ along an embedding of index types

`LocalOkaRing.incl` (`Oka/Weierstrass.lean`) reads a germ in `n` variables as a germ in `n + 1`
variables not involving the last one. Its construction uses nothing about `Fin.castSuccEmb`
beyond its being an embedding: `MvPowerSeries.LocallyConvergent.rename`, on which it rests, is
already stated for an arbitrary `e : ι ↪ κ`. This file takes the general map, `renameEmb`, and
identifies the two special cases the development already had under other names.

## Why the general map is worth having

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` indexes the coordinates of `ℂ^n` by `ULift (Fin n)`, so that
`ℂ^n` lives in an arbitrary universe (`Oka/ComplexSpace.lean`); `Oka/Weierstrass.lean` and
everything built on it indexes them by `Fin n`. A statement mentioning both an analytic space
and `LocalOkaRing.incl` therefore has to relabel `ULift (Fin n)` as `Fin n` somewhere, and
before this file there was no map to relabel it with: `LocalOkaRing.congrEquiv` relabels along a
bijection but says nothing about `incl`, and `incl` is stated only at `Fin.castSuccEmb`.

**`renameEmb` is what both of them are**, and `LocalOkaRing.congrEquiv_eq_renameEmb` and
`LocalOkaRing.incl_eq_renameEmb` say so. Once they are the same map, `renameEmb_trans` alone
proves the square that a `ULift`ed statement needs, which is
`LocalOkaRing.uliftEquiv_renameEmb` below.

## The two spellings, and why the comparison is not free

`renameEmb` is *syntactic*: it renames the variables of a power series. `congrEquiv` is
*analytic*: it is `LocalOkaRing.congr` at the linear automorphism of `ℂ^ι` permuting the
coordinates, and its value is defined by a choice of a series summing to `f ∘ φ⁻¹`. Nothing
about the definitions makes them equal, and the proof is the identity theorem: both sides sum to
`x ↦ f (x ∘ e)` near the origin, and `LocalOkaRing.congr_eq_of_represents` concludes.

## Main definitions

- `LocalOkaRing.renameEmb`: the `ℂ`-algebra map `LocalOkaRing ι →ₐ[ℂ] LocalOkaRing κ` induced by
  an embedding `ι ↪ κ` of index types, renaming the variables.
- `LocalOkaRing.uliftEquiv`: relabelling `ULift ι` as `ι`, as a `ℂ`-algebra isomorphism of germ
  rings.

## Main results

- `MvPowerSeries.Represents.renameEmb`: a series summing to `F` in the variables `ι` sums, after
  renaming along `e : ι ↪ κ`, to `x ↦ F (x ∘ e)`.
- `LocalOkaRing.renameEmb_refl` and `LocalOkaRing.renameEmb_trans`: relabelling is functorial.
- `LocalOkaRing.incl_eq_renameEmb`: **the inclusion of the Weierstrass theorems is a
  relabelling**, along `Fin.castSuccEmb`.
- `LocalOkaRing.congrEquiv_eq_renameEmb`: **the linear change of coordinates along a bijection is
  the same relabelling**, along the underlying embedding.
- `LocalOkaRing.uliftEquiv_renameEmb`: relabelling `ULift` commutes with renaming along an
  embedding, and `LocalOkaRing.uliftEquiv_renameEmb_incl`, its instance producing the inclusion
  of the Weierstrass theorems.
- `LocalOkaRing.coeff_uliftEquiv` and `LocalOkaRing.constantCoeff_uliftEquiv`: **relabelling
  `ULift` moves each coefficient to the relabelled exponent**, and fixes the constant term.

## What is not here

**`LocalOkaRing.incl` is deliberately not named in the list above**, though it is what two of the
results are stated in terms of and it is named in every paragraph before it:
`scripts/guard_coverage.py` reads a backticked name under a `## Main results` heading as a result
the file advertises, and `incl` is a result of `Oka/Weierstrass.lean`.

**No map in the other direction.** A germ in `κ` variables restricts to one in `ι` variables
only after choosing values for the variables outside the image of `e`, which is a substitution
and not a relabelling; `Oka/AnalyticSpace/ProjectionStalk.lean` records that the general
substitution does not exist in this development.

**No statement about `Oka/Weierstrass.lean`'s `lastVar`.** `renameEmb e` misses exactly the
variables outside the range of `e`, and at `Fin.castSuccEmb` that is the one variable the
Weierstrass theorems distinguish; but nothing here needs the relation and `LocalOkaRing.incl`
already carries it.

**No redefinition of `LocalOkaRing.incl`.** `incl_eq_renameEmb` holds by `rfl`, so the two are
interchangeable at every goal, and moving the definition would touch `Oka/Weierstrass.lean` for
no gain.

/-- **Reading a germ in the variables `ι` as a germ in the variables `κ`, along an embedding
`e : ι ↪ κ`.**

Geometrically this is pullback along the projection `ℂ^κ → ℂ^ι`, `x ↦ x ∘ e`, which forgets the
coordinates outside the range of `e`;
`ComplexAnalytic.okaStalkEquiv_stalkMap_okaMapHom_coordEmb` is that reading as a theorem.
Local convergence is preserved because renaming along an embedding only reindexes the variables
(`MvPowerSeries.LocallyConvergent.rename`); the `TendstoCofinite` hypothesis that lemma asks for
is automatic here, the index types being finite. -/

`congrEquiv` is defined through `LocalOkaRing.congr`, whose value at `P` is *some* locally
convergent series summing to `P.eval ∘ φ⁻¹`; `renameEmb` renames the variables. That these agree
is the identity theorem `MvPowerSeries.Represents.unique`, packaged as
`LocalOkaRing.congr_eq_of_represents`: both sides sum to `x ↦ P.eval (x ∘ e)` near the origin,
the left because `φ⁻¹` is precomposition with `e` and the right by
`LocalOkaRing.renameEmb_represents`. -/

/-- **The germ rings of `ℂ^(ULift ι)` and of `ℂ^ι` are the same ring**, relabelled.

by `Fin n`; this is the isomorphism that lets a statement mention both. -/

`E` is any embedding of the `ULift`ed index types lying over `e`, which is what the hypothesis
`hE` says; every such `E` gives the same relabelling, by `LocalOkaRing.renameEmb_congr`, so
nothing is lost by not naming one. Both composites are the relabelling along the embedding
`ULift ι ↪ κ` sending `x` to `e x.down`, and `LocalOkaRing.renameEmb_trans` reduces each side to
it.

This is the square a `ULift`-indexed statement needs in order to reach a `Fin`-indexed one. -/

verbatim. Stated at a general exponent rather than at `Finsupp.single` because the two consumers
below want `0` and `Finsupp.single i 1`, and `Finsupp.embDomain_single` specialises it. -/
