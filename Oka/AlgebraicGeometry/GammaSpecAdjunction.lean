# Missing general lemmas on the `Γ`-`Spec` adjunction

Material for `Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/GammaSpecAdjunction.lean`; see `README.md` on the mirror
tree. Nothing here is complex-analytic.

Mathlib packages the naturality of `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.toΓSpec` inside the
natural transformation `AlgebraicGeometry.identityToΓSpec`, whose components are the `toΓSpec`
maps. Reading naturality off it means unfolding `Γ.rightOp` and `Spec.toLocallyRingedSpace`,
which is exactly the step a caller does not want to repeat, so the square is restated here in
the vocabulary of `toΓSpec` and `Spec.locallyRingedSpaceMap`.

It also records the `Γ`-`Spec` adjunction in the form a caller carrying an *algebra structure*
wants. An `R`-algebra structure on a locally ringed space `X` is a ring map
`α : R →+* Γ(X, 𝒪_X)`, and the adjunction says such a thing is the same as a morphism
`X ⟶ Spec R`. Mathlib's `AlgebraicGeometry.ΓSpec.locallyRingedSpaceAdjunction` says so with the
ring on the opposite side and wrapped in `CommRingCat.ofHom`;
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.toSpecOfAlgMap` is the same map with `α` as an ordinary
`RingHom`, together with the two facts that make it usable — that it turns
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.comapAlgMap` into precomposition, and that it is a
bijection.

**Why that is worth naming.** It is what lets a family of algebra structures on the members of an
open cover be glued: as morphisms to `Spec R` they glue by
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.OpenCover.existsUnique_glueMorphisms`, and the glued
morphism is a structure on the whole space. Without it, gluing the structures means gluing
sections one constant at a time and checking the ring axioms of the result by hand.

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.toSpecOfAlgMap`: an `R`-algebra structure on `X`, as a
  morphism `X ⟶ Spec R`.

## Main results

- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.toΓSpec_naturality`: the canonical map to the spectrum
  of the global sections is natural.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.comp_toSpecOfAlgMap`: pulling an algebra structure back
  along a morphism is precomposing the corresponding map to `Spec R` with it.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.toSpecOfAlgMap_injective` and
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.exists_toSpecOfAlgMap_eq`: the correspondence is a
  bijection.

/-- **The canonical map to the spectrum of the global sections is natural.**

This is `AlgebraicGeometry.identityToΓSpec.naturality` with both functors evaluated, so that the
statement mentions only `toΓSpec` and `Spec.locallyRingedSpaceMap`. The two sides are
definitionally equal to the components of that naturality square; nothing is proved here beyond
the change of spelling. -/

/-- **An `R`-algebra structure on `X`, as a morphism `X ⟶ Spec R`.**

This is the image of `α` under `AlgebraicGeometry.ΓSpec.locallyRingedSpaceAdjunction`'s hom
equivalence — `toSpecOfAlgMap_eq_homEquiv` says so, by `rfl` — restated so that the argument is a
`RingHom` rather than a morphism of `CommRingCat` in the opposite category. The restatement is
what makes the two lemmas below expressible without unfolding `Γ.rightOp` at every use. -/

/-- **Pulling an algebra structure back along a morphism is precomposing the corresponding map to
`Spec R` with it.**

This is the half of the correspondence that does the work: it turns a statement about
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.comapAlgMap` — which is where an algebra structure on a
subspace comes from — into one about composition of morphisms, where the gluing machinery lives.
The proof is `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.toΓSpec_naturality`, which is why that lemma
is in this file. -/

/-- **Every map to `Spec R` comes from an algebra structure.**

Stated existentially rather than as an inverse map because that is the form a caller wants: a
morphism produced by gluing is not built from a structure, and this is what turns it back into
one. -/
