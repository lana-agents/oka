# A global section of `𝒪_{Spec R}` vanishes at a prime exactly when it lies in it

Material for `Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/StructureSheaf.lean`; see `README.md` on the mirror tree.

Mathlib proves the other direction — the germ of `a` at `x` is a unit when `x ∈ basicOpen a` —
as `isUnit_toStalk` in `Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/StructureSheaf.lean`, and **that declaration is
not `public` under the module system, so it is not merely unstated here but uncitable**. The
direction below is the one every consumer wants anyway, because it is the hypothesis of the
criteria that say a quotient sheaf is *not* zero.

Both are one step from the stalk being the localisation at the prime
(`AlgebraicGeometry.StructureSheaf.IsLocalization.to_stalk`), and the step is
`IsLocalization.AtPrime.to_map_mem_maximal_iff`.

## Main results

- `AlgebraicGeometry.StructureSheaf.germ_algebraMap_mem_maximalIdeal_iff`: **the germ at `p` of
  the global section attached to `a` lies in the maximal ideal of the stalk exactly when `a ∈ p`.**
- `AlgebraicGeometry.StructureSheaf.germ_algebraMap_mem_maximalIdeal_iff'`: the same at the
  `Spec.locallyRingedSpaceObj` spelling, which is the one a consumer holding a locally ringed
  space is in. The two statements are definitionally the same and neither `rw` nor instance
  search crosses between them; the second exists so that no caller has to.

/-- **The germ at `p` of the global section of `𝒪_{Spec R}` attached to `a : R` lies in the
maximal ideal of the stalk exactly when `a` lies in `p`.**

The stalk is the localisation of `R` at `p`
(`AlgebraicGeometry.StructureSheaf.IsLocalization.to_stalk`) and the germ of the global section
is the image of `a` under the localisation map
(`AlgebraicGeometry.StructureSheaf.algebraMap_germ_apply`), so this is
`IsLocalization.AtPrime.to_map_mem_maximal_iff`.

The `IsLocalRing` instance on the stalk is stated in the `Spec.locallyRingedSpaceObj` spelling,
which instance search does not cross to `Spec.structureSheaf`; it is introduced by
`inferInstanceAs` inside the statement rather than by an instance declaration, so that no new
global instance is created for a seam. -/

/-- **The germ criterion at the `Spec.locallyRingedSpaceObj` spelling.**

`AlgebraicGeometry.StructureSheaf.germ_algebraMap_mem_maximalIdeal_iff` says the same thing about
`Spec.structureSheaf`. The two are definitionally equal and the proof below is `exact`, which
crosses at default transparency; **instance search does not cross, which is why the first
statement has to carry its `IsLocalRing` instance by hand and this one does not**, and `rw` does
not cross either, which is why a consumer holding a locally ringed space needs this spelling
rather than the first.

The section itself is written in the `Spec.structureSheaf` spelling because the `Algebra R`
instance is stated there and nowhere else; that ascription is the one place a caller meets the
seam. -/
