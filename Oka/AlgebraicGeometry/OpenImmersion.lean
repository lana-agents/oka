# Sections over the range of an open immersion of schemes, in `basicOpen` form

Material for `Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/OpenImmersion.lean`; see `README.md` on the mirror tree.
Upstreaming it adds nothing: that file's transitive closure is **2039** Mathlib modules, the
import above is the target itself, and the cost is **0**, measured with
`python3 scripts/import_cost.py Oka/AlgebraicGeometry/OpenImmersion.lean`. There is no competing
destination to weigh against it.

`AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion.ΓIsoTop` there is `Γ(X, ⊤) ≅ Γ(Y, f.opensRange)` for an open
immersion `f : X ⟶ Y`. **Everything this file adds is about `basicOpen`**, because that is what a
caller who has reached for the isomorphism wants next: the distinguished open of a section over
`f.opensRange` is the image of a distinguished open of `X`. The `Spec` isomorphism below is the
same statement's input in the form a caller with an affine open cover is in, and it is one
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.ΓSpecIso` away from Mathlib's.

## The isomorphism itself is Mathlib's, and this file's first version redefined it

**`AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion.ΓIsoTop` is 570 lines below the
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.appIso` this file's first version cited, in the file it names as its
upstream target** — line 225 against line 795 of
`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/OpenImmersion.lean`. That version declared
*Scheme.Hom.opensRangeIso* (not backticked, because it names nothing in this tree) as
`Γ(Y, f.opensRange)` ≅ `Γ(X, ⊤)`, out of the same two components routed the same way and pointing
the other way — so `(IsOpenImmersion.ΓIsoTop f).symm` on the nose. Re-run here rather than taken
from the review that found it: restoring the old definition in a scratch file and elaborating
`ext : 1; simp [IsOpenImmersion.ΓIsoTop]` against it is `lake env lean`, **exit 0**. It was
caught in review (lana-agents/oka#374) and removed.

A mirror-tree file cannot hold a declaration that is already in its target file: `README.md` makes
the mirror path *"a claim about where the results would go upstream"*, so a duplicate there is a
wrong claim about the destination and not only a redundant name.

**The check that would have found it takes one command and it is not the import-cost check.**

```
grep -rn "opensRange" .lake/packages/mathlib/Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/ --include=*.lean | grep "≅"
```

It returns **six** lines and the two that matter are the first two, both in the target file
itself: `Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/OpenImmersion.lean:770`, which is
`AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion.ΓIso`, and `:796`, which is the statement. The other four are
`Restrict.lean:419` (`X ≅ f.opensRange`, a scheme and not a ring), `Restrict.lean:695` and
`Pullbacks.lean:659` (isomorphisms of `CategoryTheory.Arrow`) and
`Morphisms/RingHomProperties.lean:606` (a `let` inside a proof). **Reading the hits is the step,
not counting them** — a first draft of this paragraph said *"three hits"*, which is the same
species of defect as the one the paragraph is about.

**For a mirror-tree file the search is for the *statement*, and it has to run before the file is
written**; the import-cost measurement is the second test and it passed at 0 while the first had
never been run. `README.md`'s mirror-tree section is where this belongs if it is ever written down
as a rule rather than as this paragraph.

## Why `basicOpen` survives the transport, and it is Mathlib's design decision and not ours

`AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion.ΓIsoTop` spends the equality
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Hom.image_top_eq_opensRange` as `Y.presheaf.mapIso` rather than as an
`eqToIso` between the two rings, and **that choice is exactly what makes the two theorems below
four rewrites each.** `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.basicOpen_res_eq` — *`basicOpen` is unchanged by
restriction along an isomorphism of opens* — is stated for `X.presheaf.map i` with `[IsIso i]`, and
an `eqToHom` between two ring objects is not of that shape. Measured here, on this file's first
version, which had reconstructed Mathlib's definition down to this decision before knowing it was
Mathlib's: with the `eqToIso` spelling the first theorem below leaves a heterogeneous goal
`(f.appIso ⊤).inv r ≍ …` that `congr` produces and nothing discharges. The two spellings are
propositionally equal and the choice is entirely about which lemma applies to the result.

## Naming Mathlib's definition in a `rw` plants an equation lemma into Mathlib's namespace

`rw [ΓIsoTop, …]` is the obvious spelling of the first proof below and it is the wrong one:
naming a `def` as a rewrite rule asks Lean to generate its equation lemma, and `ΓIsoTop` is
**not this repository's declaration**. Measured — `scripts/DumpOkaDecls.lean` on the draft that
did it reports `AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion.ΓIsoTop.eq_1` as declared by
`Oka.AlgebraicGeometry.OpenImmersion`, so this module was adding a lemma to a Mathlib definition
it only imports. `Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumRange.lean` and
`Oka/Analytification/RefineDatumCocycle.lean` record the same hazard by two other routes,
`simp only` and `CategoryTheory.reassoc_of%`; **this is the third route and the cheapest to walk
into, because the rewrite is the one a reader would write first.**

What replaces it is `have h : (ΓIsoTop f).hom = … := rfl` and a rewrite by `h`. A `rfl` proof goes
through definitional unfolding, which generates nothing, and the equation is then local to the
proof. The same substitution is made below for `specΓIsoTop`, which is this file's own definition
and where the cost is only a stray row in the dump; with both, `Δdump` is **+3** for the three
declarations here.

Mathlib has no `ΓIsoTop_hom` or `ΓIsoTop_inv`, though it has `ΓIso_inv` for the neighbouring
`AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion.ΓIso` — measured with
`grep -rn "ΓIsoTop_\|ΓIso_hom\|ΓIso_inv" .lake/packages/mathlib/Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/`,
which returns `ΓIso_inv`, `map_ΓIso_inv` and `app_ΓIso_hom` and nothing at `Top`.
**Supplying one is a
candidate for this file and is deliberately not taken here**: it would be a fourth declaration
whose only consumer is one `have`, and the branch this file arrived on was rejected for adding a
declaration Mathlib already had. A later caller that needs the unfolding more than once should
add it.

## Main definitions

- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion.specΓIsoTop`: **for an open immersion `f : Spec R ⟶ Y`,
  sections of `𝒪_Y` over `f.opensRange` are `R` itself**, which is the form a caller with an
  affine open cover is in.

## Main results

- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion.image_basicOpen_ΓIsoTop`: the image of a distinguished open
  of `X` is the distinguished open of the corresponding section over `f.opensRange`.
- `AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion.image_primeSpectrum_basicOpen`: the image of `D(a)` for
  `a : R` is the distinguished open of the corresponding section over `f.opensRange`.

## What is not here

* **No isomorphism between global sections and sections over the range.** That is
  `AlgebraicGeometry.IsOpenImmersion.ΓIsoTop` and it is Mathlib's; the section above says what
  happened to the copy this file used to carry.
* **Nothing along `AlgebraicGeometry.IsAffineOpen.fromSpec`.**
  `AlgebraicGeometry.IsAffineOpen.fromSpec_image_basicOpen` is Mathlib's nearest statement to the
  second theorem below — `hU.fromSpec ''ᵁ PrimeSpectrum.basicOpen f = X.basicOpen f` for a section
  `f` over an affine open — and it is a different statement: its morphism is the canonical one
  attached to an affine open and its element is a section of `𝒪_X`, where the one below takes an
  arbitrary open immersion out of a spectrum and an element of the ring. Deducing either from the
  other needs the identification of `R` with `Γ(Y, f.opensRange)`, which is the definition below;
  nothing here does it and nothing here needs it.
* **No naturality and no uniqueness.** Neither isomorphism here is related to a morphism of the
  data it is built from.

caller holding an affine open cover is in: the cover gives the morphisms `Spec Rᵢ ⟶ Y` and asks
what a section over the `i`-th member is, and the answer is an element of `Rᵢ` and not a global
section of an auxiliary scheme. -/
