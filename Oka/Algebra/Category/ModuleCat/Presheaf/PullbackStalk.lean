# The stalk of a pullback of presheaves of modules is the base change of the stalk

Material for `Mathlib/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Presheaf/Pullback.lean`; see `README.md` on the
mirror tree.

For a continuous map `f : X ⟶ Y`, a morphism of presheaves of commutative rings
`φ : S ⟶ (Opens.map f).op ⋙ R` and a point `x : X`,

```
PresheafOfModules.pullbackStalkIso :
  pullback φ ⋙ stalkFunctor x ≅ stalkFunctor (f x) ⋙ ModuleCat.extendScalars (ringStalkMap f φ x)
```

— **`(f^* M)_x ≅ R_x ⊗_{S_{f x}} M_{f x}`, naturally in `M`.**

## Why this is a theorem rather than a rewrite

`PresheafOfModules.pullback φ` is *defined* as `(pushforward φ).leftAdjoint`. Searching Mathlib
at `master` = `c52b0cc` for a description of it as a tensor product:
`grep -rln "TensorProduct\|tensorObj" Mathlib/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Presheaf/` returns only
`Presheaf/Monoidal.lean`, which is the monoidal structure over a *fixed* presheaf of rings and
not a change of rings; over `Mathlib/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/` it returns nothing. The
word `stalk` does not occur in either directory. **So the functor exists and the formula does
not**, and there is nothing to instantiate.

## The proof, which never touches the definition of `pullback`

Both sides are left adjoints, and the whole content is that their right adjoints agree:

* `pullback φ ⋙ stalkFunctor x` is left adjoint to
  `skyscraperFunctor x ⋙ pushforward φ`, by `pullbackPushforwardAdjunction` composed with
  `stalkSkyscraperAdj`;
* `stalkFunctor (f x) ⋙ extendScalars` is left adjoint to
  `restrictScalars ⋙ skyscraperFunctor (f x)`, by `stalkSkyscraperAdj` composed with
  `ModuleCat.extendRestrictScalarsAdj`;

and `skyscraperFunctorPushforwardIso` says the two right adjoints are isomorphic — **pushing a
skyscraper at `x` forward along `f` is the skyscraper at `f x`**. That is where the geometry is,
and it is almost definitional: the underlying abelian presheaves are *equal*, since
`x ∈ (Opens.map f).obj V` is `f x ∈ V`, so the comparison morphism is built by `homMk (𝟙 _)` and
its two round trips are `rfl`. The only thing to prove is that the two module structures agree,
and that is `ringStalkMap_germ`.

`Adjunction.leftAdjointUniq` then produces the natural isomorphism.

**No flatness is used anywhere and none is needed.** The base-change *formula* holds for an
arbitrary morphism of ringed spaces; flatness is what turns it into an exactness statement, and
that is a separate theorem.

## Main definitions

- `PresheafOfModules.ringStalkMap`: the induced map `S_{f x} ⟶ R_x` on stalks of the presheaves
  of rings.

## Main results

- `PresheafOfModules.skyscraperFunctorPushforwardIso`: the pushforward of a skyscraper is a
  skyscraper.
- `PresheafOfModules.pullbackStalkIso`: **the stalk of a pullback is the base change of the
  stalk.**

## What is not here

* **The sheaf-level statement.** `SheafOfModules.pullback` is a presheaf pullback followed by
  sheafification, so the sheaf-level version needs additionally that the skyscraper is a sheaf.
* **Exactness.** See above: this file consumes no flatness because the statement needs none.
