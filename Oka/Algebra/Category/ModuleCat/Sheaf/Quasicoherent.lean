# Finiteness of presentations: binding, mapping, and restricting along a morphism of the site

Material for `Mathlib/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/Quasicoherent.lean`; see `README.md` on
the mirror tree. Nothing here needs an import that file does not already have.

Three gaps in Mathlib's `SheafOfModules.Presentation` API, all of the same shape: a presentation
is transported by a construction that does not touch either index type, and
`SheafOfModules.Presentation.IsFinite` is finiteness of the two index types and nothing else, so
the finiteness wanted **is** the finiteness given — but instance search does not see it, because
each transport is an ordinary definition.

**The instance to state is the one at the outer definition, and not the one at
`SheafOfModules.Presentation.map` underneath it.** An instance
`(P.map F η).IsFinite` was written, at the full generality of `map`, and then deleted: nothing can
consume it. Every consumer here — `SheafOfModules.Presentation.restrict` below,
`SheafOfModules.Presentation.quasicoherentData`,
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Modules.presentationRestrict` — is an ordinary definition wrapping the
`map`, and the two fields have to be given at the wrapper regardless.

**An earlier version of this paragraph said the reason was that search "does not reach the `map`
goal at all", and that is wrong; the conclusion is right and the correct reason is stronger.**
A `set_option trace.Meta.synthInstance true` run on the goal left by `unfold` shows Mathlib's
`SheafOfModules.Presentation.ofIsIso` instance firing and producing exactly the `map` goal — so
search does reach it — and then failing to unify that goal with an instance whose head prints
identically, the two `SheafOfModules.Presentation.map` applications differing in an argument that
is not reducibly defeq. Supplying the missing instance does not help: not as a `haveI`, and **not
as a global `instance` declared at exactly the shape `SheafOfModules.Presentation.restrict` uses**,
which is a stronger negative than delete-and-rebuild gives. A `tryResolve` line whose two sides
print the same is the signature of that, and it means no declaration is missing.

`SheafOfModules.QuasicoherentData.bind` refines a cover: given a cover on which `M` has
quasicoherent data, and, for each member, a cover of that member on which the restriction has
presentations, it produces quasicoherent data of `M` on the composite cover. Mathlib records that
the composite is quasicoherent data and **not** that it is finite when the pieces are, which is
what a construction producing local *finite* presentations needs on the way out.

## The proof is definitional, and that is the whole point

`SheafOfModules.Presentation.IsFinite` is finiteness of the two index types and nothing else, and
neither transport `bind` performs — `SheafOfModules.Presentation.map` along the equivalence with
the iterated slice, then `SheafOfModules.Presentation.ofIsIso` — touches an index type.
`SheafOfModules.Presentation.map_generators_I` and `SheafOfModules.Presentation.map_relations_I`
are the statements of that for the first, and both hold by `rfl`. So the finiteness wanted **is**
the finiteness given, up to definitional unfolding, and each field below is the source's
`SheafOfModules.GeneratingSections.IsFiniteType.finite` put back inside the constructor.

Instance search does not find it on its own, and **the blocker is
`SheafOfModules.QuasicoherentData.bind` itself and not the layer below it**. `bind` is an ordinary
definition, so search does not unfold it far enough to see the presentations it is assembled from,
and never reaches `SheafOfModules.Presentation.ofIsIso` or `SheafOfModules.Presentation.map` at
all. Mathlib does have an `IsFinite` instance for `ofIsIso` and none for `map`, but that gap is not
the cause: supplying the missing one — three lines, since both index types are the source's —
still leaves `infer_instance` failing on the composite goal. That is why this is stated rather
than left to the elaborator at the call site.

## Restricting a presentation along a morphism of the site

`SheafOfModules.Presentation.restrict` is the presentation-level analogue of this repository's
`SheafOfModules.GeneratingSections.restrict`: if `M` has a presentation over `Y`, it has one over
any `X` lying over `Y`. It is what an argument that refines a covering needs when the data being
carried is a presentation rather than a generating family —
`SheafOfModules.IsFinitePresentation` hands out presentations over the members of *some* covering,
and a caller which wants them over a covering of its own choosing has to move them.

**There was a reason to doubt that it would be as cheap as the generating-sections version, and
it is worth recording that the doubt was well placed and wrong.**
`SheafOfModules.GeneratingSections.restrict` finishes with
`SheafOfModules.GeneratingSections.ofEpi`, and a presentation does *not* transport along an
epimorphism: one would need generators of the
kernel too. What makes it cheap is that the morphism `ofEpi` is applied to there is not merely an
epimorphism — `SheafOfModules.overFunctorMap` is a natural *isomorphism*, built by
`CategoryTheory.NatIso.ofComponents` from `Iso.refl` — and Mathlib already has the transport of a
presentation along an isomorphism, `SheafOfModules.Presentation.ofIsIso`. So the definition below
is the generating-sections one with `ofEpi` replaced by `ofIsIso`, under exactly the hypotheses
that one carries and no new one.

## A global presentation is a local one

`SheafOfModules.Presentation.isFinitePresentation` says that a sheaf with a finite **global**
presentation satisfies Mathlib's `SheafOfModules.IsFinitePresentation`, the class asserting a
finite presentation over the members of *some* covering. Mathlib has
`SheafOfModules.Presentation.quasicoherentData`, which puts a global presentation on the trivial
covering, and `SheafOfModules.Presentation.isQuasicoherent`, which reads off quasicoherence from
it; the finite version of the second is not there, and the instance it needs is the finite version
of `SheafOfModules.Presentation.map` above, because `quasicoherentData` presents `M.over X` as
`P.map` along a pushforward.

It is what makes a theorem stated at `SheafOfModules.IsFinitePresentation` strictly stronger than
the same theorem stated at a global presentation, rather than merely differently stated — and, in
this repository, what gives such a theorem a witness at all, since the only sheaf on a `Spec` here
with any presentation is `OkaTest/AffineSections.lean`'s, and its presentation is global.

## A presentation exhibits its sheaf as a cokernel of free sheaves

`SheafOfModules.Presentation.cokernelIso` is the isomorphism `cokernel ψ ≅ M`, where
`ψ : free P.relations.I ⟶ free P.generators.I` is the map a presentation is built out of. Mathlib
has `SheafOfModules.Presentation.isColimit`, which says the relevant cofork is a colimit, and
`SheafOfModules.presentationOfIsCokernelFree`, which goes the other way; what is missing is the
isomorphism itself, which is what a consumer stated for a cokernel — such as
`ComplexAnalytic.isCoherent_analytificationSheaf_cokernel` — actually wants. It is
`CategoryTheory.Limits.IsColimit.coconePointUniqueUpToIso` and nothing else.

**The map is written out rather than named**, because Mathlib does not name it either: it appears
only inside the type of `SheafOfModules.Presentation.isColimit`, as
`(freeHomEquiv _).symm P.relations.s ≫ kernel.ι P.generators.π`. Anything downstream has to spell
it the same way.

/-- **A presentation restricts along a morphism of the site.**

If `M` has a presentation over `Y`, it has one over any `X` lying over `Y`. This is the
presentation-level analogue of this repository's `SheafOfModules.GeneratingSections.restrict`,
and it is that definition with `SheafOfModules.GeneratingSections.ofEpi` replaced by
`SheafOfModules.Presentation.ofIsIso`; see the module docstring for why that replacement is
available and why it is the whole content. The hypotheses are the ones
`SheafOfModules.GeneratingSections.restrict` already carries, `HasPullbacks C` being the
load-bearing one: it is what makes `SheafOfModules.overMap` a left adjoint, hence colimit
preserving, hence eligible for `SheafOfModules.Presentation.map`. Nothing here is specific to a
topological site. -/

/-- **Restriction preserves finiteness of a presentation**, because neither
`SheafOfModules.Presentation.map` nor `SheafOfModules.Presentation.ofIsIso` changes either index
type.

The two fields are the source's, exactly as for
`SheafOfModules.QuasicoherentData.isFinitePresentation_bind` and for the same reason. **They are
given rather than left to `unfold` followed by `infer_instance`**, which is what
`SheafOfModules.GeneratingSections.isFiniteType_restrict` does: after `unfold` the goal is
`SheafOfModules.Presentation.ofIsIso`'s, whose `IsFinite` instance Mathlib does state, and search
still fails on it — measured, and not explained here. -/

/-- **The quasicoherent datum a finite global presentation puts on the trivial covering is
finite.**

`SheafOfModules.Presentation.quasicoherentData` presents `M.over X` as `P.map` along a pushforward
along an identity, and `SheafOfModules.Presentation.map` changes neither index type; the two
fields are the source's, as everywhere else in this file. -/

      isFiniteType_relations := ⟨inferInstanceAs (Finite P.relations.I)⟩ }

/-- **A sheaf with a finite global presentation is of finite presentation.**

The finite analogue of `SheafOfModules.Presentation.isQuasicoherent`, and the trivial covering is
the whole of it. It is stated because it is what relates the two shapes a theorem about finite
presentations can take — a hypothesis of a global `SheafOfModules.Presentation` that is finite,
and Mathlib's class `SheafOfModules.IsFinitePresentation` — and without it a theorem at the class
cannot be checked against a sheaf that was *built* as a cokernel of finite free sheaves, which is
the only kind this repository has on a `Spec`.

**Not an instance.** A `SheafOfModules.Presentation` is data and is not found by search, so this
would be a hypothesis-free instance that can never fire; it is applied at a presentation in
hand. -/

/-- **A presentation exhibits its sheaf as the cokernel of a map of free sheaves.**

`SheafOfModules.Presentation.isColimit` says that the cofork on
`(freeHomEquiv _).symm P.relations.s ≫ kernel.ι P.generators.π` with `P.generators.π` for its
projection is a colimit; this reads that off as an isomorphism from the chosen cokernel, by
`CategoryTheory.Limits.IsColimit.coconePointUniqueUpToIso`. There is no content beyond that.

It is stated because the *cokernel* form is what consumers ask for. A theorem proved about
`cokernel ψ` for a map of finite free sheaves — this repository's is
`ComplexAnalytic.isCoherent_analytificationSheaf_cokernel` — applies to a sheaf with a finite
presentation only through this isomorphism, and Mathlib provides the colimit but not the
isomorphism.

Note that the map is written out and not abbreviated. Mathlib does not name it: it exists only
inside the type of `SheafOfModules.Presentation.isColimit`, so a consumer has to spell it
identically or the two will not match. -/
