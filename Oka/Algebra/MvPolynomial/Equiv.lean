# Evaluating through `MvPolynomial.optionEquivLeft`

`MvPolynomial.optionEquivLeft R σ`, the algebra equivalence
`MvPolynomial (Option σ) R ≃ₐ[R] Polynomial (MvPolynomial σ R)`, makes
the variable `none` the polynomial variable and the variables `some s` the coefficients. This file
adds the one lemma that says what that does to evaluation: evaluating at a point of
`Option σ → R` is evaluating the coefficients at its restriction along `some` and then evaluating
the resulting one-variable polynomial at its value on `none`.

`Mathlib/Algebra/MvPolynomial/Equiv.lean` has this for `MvPolynomial.finSuccEquiv`
(`MvPolynomial.eval_eq_eval_mv_eval'`) and not for the `Option` equivalence it is built from, so
a caller whose splitting of the variables is not `Fin.cons` cannot use it. The proof here is the
proof of that lemma with `Fin.cases` replaced by `Option.rec`.

/-- **Evaluation through `MvPolynomial.optionEquivLeft`**: the variables `some s` are evaluated
into the coefficients and the variable `none` into the polynomial variable.

This is `MvPolynomial.eval_eq_eval_mv_eval'` for the `Option` splitting rather than the
`Fin.cons` one. -/
