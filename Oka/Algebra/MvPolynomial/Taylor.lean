# Shifting the variables of a multivariate polynomial

Material for `Mathlib/Algebra/MvPolynomial/Taylor.lean`; see `README.md` on the mirror tree.

Mathlib has `Polynomial.taylor` and `Polynomial.taylorEquiv` in one variable. This file is the
multivariate analogue: substituting `xᵢ + zᵢ` for `xᵢ` is an `R`-algebra automorphism of
`MvPolynomial σ R`, and the coefficients of the image of `p` are the Taylor coefficients of `p`
at `z`.

## Main definitions

- `MvPolynomial.taylorAlgHom z`: the substitution `p ↦ p(x + z)`.
- `MvPolynomial.taylorEquiv z`: the same map as an algebra automorphism, its inverse being the
  substitution at `-z`.

## Main results

- `MvPolynomial.eval_taylorAlgHom`: `p(x + z)` evaluated at `w` is `p` evaluated at `w + z`.
  This is the reason to have the definition: it is what turns a statement at a general point
  into the corresponding statement at the origin.
- `MvPolynomial.constantCoeff_taylorAlgHom`: the constant term of `p(x + z)` is the value of `p`
  at `z` — the zeroth of the Taylor coefficients the first paragraph promises, and the only one
  expressible in this file.

## What is not here

**No Taylor coefficient beyond the constant one.** Every other one is a derivative, and
`MvPolynomial.pderiv` is not in this file's import closure: adding
`Mathlib.Algebra.MvPolynomial.PDeriv` would add 118 Mathlib modules to it, by
`scripts/import_cost.py`. The degree-one case is in the mirror file for that Mathlib module,
where the same import costs nothing.

This is the degree-zero Taylor coefficient, and it is the only one that can be stated in this
file: every higher one is a derivative, and `MvPolynomial.pderiv` is not in this file's import
closure. See `MvPolynomial.coeff_single_one_taylorAlgHom` for the degree-one case.

The proof is `MvPolynomial.eval_taylorAlgHom` at `w = 0`, since the constant term *is* the value
at the origin (`MvPolynomial.eval_zero`); no induction is needed. -/
