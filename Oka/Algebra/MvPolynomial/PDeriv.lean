# The linear Taylor coefficients of a multivariate polynomial are its partial derivatives

Material for `Mathlib/Algebra/MvPolynomial/PDeriv.lean`; see `README.md` on the mirror tree.

`Oka/Algebra/MvPolynomial/Taylor.lean` shifts the variables — `MvPolynomial.taylorAlgHom z` is
`p ↦ p(x + z)` — and its module docstring says the coefficients of the image are the Taylor
coefficients of `p` at `z`. It states that for the constant term
(`MvPolynomial.constantCoeff_taylorAlgHom`) and cannot state it for any other, because a Taylor
coefficient beyond the constant one is a derivative and `MvPolynomial.pderiv` is not in that
file's import closure. This file is the degree-one case, and it is a separate file for exactly
that reason: `Mathlib.Algebra.MvPolynomial.PDeriv` costs **118 Mathlib modules** against
`Mathlib/Algebra/MvPolynomial/Eval.lean`'s closure, which is what `Taylor.lean` imports, and
**0** against `Mathlib/Algebra/MvPolynomial/PDeriv.lean`'s own, which is what this file mirrors —
both measured with `scripts/import_cost.py`. The mirror layering therefore matches the layering
an upstreamed pair of files would have.

## Main results

- `MvPolynomial.coeff_single_one_taylorAlgHom`: **the coefficient of `xᵢ` in `p(x + z)` is
  `∂p/∂xᵢ` evaluated at `z`.**

## What is not here

**No higher Taylor coefficient.** The coefficient at `Finsupp.single i k` is `∂ᵏp/∂xᵢᵏ` at `z`
divided by `k!`, which needs the base ring to have the factorials invertible and is a different
statement; and the coefficient at a general exponent is a mixed partial. Only the degree-one case
is used, by `LocalOkaRing.coeff_single_one_ofMvPolynomial` in `Oka/Polynomial/Germ.lean`, and it
is the only one that needs no hypothesis on `R` at all.

/-- **The linear Taylor coefficient is the partial derivative**: the coefficient of `xᵢ` in
`p(x + z)` is `∂p/∂xᵢ` evaluated at `z`.

Both sides are additive in `p` and agree on constants, so the content is the multiplication step,
and there `MvPolynomial.coeff_mul_X'` splits on whether the variable being multiplied in is `i`:
if it is, the surviving coefficient is the constant term of `p(x + z)`, which is
`MvPolynomial.constantCoeff_taylorAlgHom`, and it matches the term
`MvPolynomial.pderiv_X_self` contributes on the other side; if it is not, both extra terms
vanish. The induction is `MvPolynomial.induction_on`, so no monomial expansion appears.

`MvPolynomial.coeff_mul_X'` decides membership in a `Finsupp.support`, so the proof opens
`classical`; the statement needs no `DecidableEq σ` and the `unusedDecidableInType` linter is
what says so. -/
