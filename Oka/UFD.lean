# The germ ring is a unique factorisation domain

The ring `LocalOkaRing ι` of germs at the origin of holomorphic functions in finitely many
complex variables is a unique factorisation domain. This is the second classical algebraic
consequence of the Weierstrass theorems, after the Rückert basis theorem of `Oka/Noetherian.lean`,
and it is what makes the local theory of analytic hypersurfaces work.

Being a domain is inherited from `MvPowerSeries ι ℂ`. Factoriality is proved by induction on the
number of variables. Since the germ ring is Noetherian it is a `WfDvdMonoid`, so only
`Irreducible → Prime` has to be established, and the whole argument is the transfer of
factorisations across `LocalOkaRing.fromPolynomial`.

Write `R := LocalOkaRing (Fin n)` and `S := LocalOkaRing (Fin (n + 1))`. Given an irreducible
`f : S`, a linear change of coordinates (`LocalOkaRing.exists_congr_localweierstrass_preparation`)
makes `f` a unit times the germ of a Weierstrass polynomial `w ∈ R[X]`. The two transfers are:

* **units.** A factor `p` of `w` whose germ is a unit is itself a unit. Evaluating coefficients
  at the origin sends `w` to `X ^ d` in `ℂ[X]`, and a divisor of `X ^ d` with nonvanishing
  constant term is a nonzero constant; the leading coefficient of `p` is a unit because `w` is
  monic, so this degree computation survives back in `R[X]`. Hence `w` is irreducible, and
  therefore prime, `R[X]` being a unique factorisation domain by Gauss's lemma.
* **divisibility.** Conversely, the germ of `w` divides the germ of `p` only if `w` divides `p`,
  by the uniqueness half of Weierstrass division. Applied to the remainders of a product, this
  turns primality of `w` in `R[X]` into primality of its germ in `S`.

## Main results

- `LocalOkaRing.instIsDomain`: the germ ring is an integral domain.
- `LocalOkaRing.map_constantCoeff_eq_X_pow`: a Weierstrass polynomial of degree `d` becomes
  `X ^ d` when its coefficients are evaluated at the origin.
- `LocalOkaRing.isUnit_of_isUnit_fromPolynomial`: a factor of a Weierstrass polynomial whose
  germ is a unit is a unit.
- `LocalOkaRing.dvd_of_fromPolynomial_dvd`: divisibility by a Weierstrass polynomial may be
  tested on germs.
- `LocalOkaRing.prime_fromPolynomial`: a prime Weierstrass polynomial has prime germ.
- `LocalOkaRing.uniqueFactorizationMonoid_fin` and
  `LocalOkaRing.instUniqueFactorizationMonoid`: the germ ring is a unique factorisation domain.
