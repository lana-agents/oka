# The completion of the germ ring is the formal power series ring

The germ ring `LocalOkaRing ι` of convergent power series sits inside `MvPowerSeries ι ℂ` by
construction. This file shows that the larger ring is exactly its **completion** at the maximal
ideal `𝔪` of germs vanishing at the origin:

```
LocalOkaRing.adicCompletionEquiv : MvPowerSeries ι ℂ ≃ₐ[ℂ] AdicCompletion 𝔪 (LocalOkaRing ι)
```

and that the inclusion of the germs is the canonical map into the completion
(`LocalOkaRing.toAdicCompletion_coe`) — without which the isomorphism would be a statement about
two abstract `ℂ`-algebras rather than about convergent and formal power series.

Since the completion of a Noetherian local ring is faithfully flat over it, the corollary is that

```
LocalOkaRing.instFaithfullyFlat : Module.FaithfullyFlat (LocalOkaRing ι) (MvPowerSeries ι ℂ)
```

**formal power series are faithfully flat over convergent ones** — the classical statement that
makes formal computations with germs conclusive. `LocalOkaRing.coe_mem_map_iff` is one reading of
it: a germ that lies **formally** in an ideal of germs — that is, in the ideal it generates in
`ℂ⟦x⟧` — lies in that ideal of germs already.

## The analytic content is elsewhere, and this file is the limit of it

Nothing here is analysis. The one analytic fact is that the germ ring and the formal power series
have the **same truncations**, `LocalOkaRing.truncQuotientEquiv` in `Oka/MaximalIdeal.lean`:
surjectivity because a truncated power series is a polynomial, hence convergent, and injectivity
because a germ vanishing to order `k` is a formal power series vanishing to order `k`. That is
"convergent series are dense in formal ones", and it is the whole of the mathematics. What this
file adds is the passage to the limit, which is bookkeeping over Mathlib's
`AdicCompletion.liftAlgHom` and the completeness of `MvPowerSeries` already registered in
`Oka/Weierstrass.lean`.

The two directions of the bijection use the two halves of that completeness. Injectivity is
separation — a formal power series lying in every `𝔪̂ ^ k` is zero, which is
`MvPowerSeries.mem_maximalIdeal_pow_iff` coefficientwise. Surjectivity is precompleteness: an
element of the completion is a compatible family of truncations, which lifts to a Cauchy sequence
of formal power series, which converges.

## What is *not* here

**This is not the flatness of `𝒪_{𝔸^ι, z} → 𝒪_{ℂ^ι, z}`**, the analytic input to GAGA (taxis
#600). Two things stand between this file and that statement, neither of them attempted here:

* that the completion of `Localization.AtPrime (MvPolynomial ι ℂ) (ker (eval z))` at its maximal
  ideal is again `MvPowerSeries ι ℂ` — Mathlib has
  `MvPowerSeries.toAdicCompletionAlgEquiv` for the polynomial ring at the ideal of variables, and
  what is missing is the comparison with the localisation;
* the local criterion — that a local homomorphism of Noetherian local rings is flat as soon as
  the induced map of completions is. This was searched for in Mathlib and not found; that is a
  negative claim about Mathlib and should be re-checked rather than believed.

`Oka/Analytification/AffineSpace.lean` names flatness as an outstanding item and **still should**:
this file does not discharge it.

## Main definitions

- `LocalOkaRing.truncHom`: truncation of a formal power series to order `k`, landing in
  `𝒪 ⧸ 𝔪 ^ k`.
- `LocalOkaRing.toAdicCompletion`: a formal power series read as an element of the `𝔪`-adic
  completion of the germ ring, namely the compatible family of its truncations.
- `LocalOkaRing.adicCompletionEquiv`: **the `𝔪`-adic completion of the germ ring is the formal
  power series ring.**

## Main results

- `LocalOkaRing.toAdicCompletion_coe`: **the isomorphism is the one induced by the inclusion** —
  a convergent power series goes to its own image in the completion.
- `LocalOkaRing.instFaithfullyFlat`: **`MvPowerSeries ι ℂ` is faithfully flat over
  `LocalOkaRing ι`.**
- `LocalOkaRing.coe_mem_map_iff`: a germ lies in an ideal of germs as soon as it lies in the
  ideal it generates formally.

Read the other way round — `adicCompletionEquiv.symm` — this says that the completion of the

literature makes.

It is the isomorphism *induced by the inclusion*: see `LocalOkaRing.toAdicCompletion_coe`,
