# Germs of polynomial functions

The germ at a point `y ∈ ℂ^ι` of the holomorphic function defined by a polynomial, as a
`ℂ`-algebra map `MvPolynomial ι ℂ →ₐ[ℂ] LocalOkaRing ι`.

This is separated from `Oka/Polynomial.lean` because `OkaRing.germ` lives in
`Oka/Weierstrass.lean`, and "a polynomial function is holomorphic" should not depend on
Weierstrass theory.

`Oka/MaximalIdeal.lean` is imported for `LocalOkaRing.coord` alone, which
`LocalOkaRing.ofMvPolynomial_zero_X` names. `Oka/Analytification/Flatness.lean` used to hold that
declaration and its corollary, and said in terms that it did so *"only because the proof names
`LocalOkaRing.coord`, which lives in `Oka/MaximalIdeal.lean` and is not in that file's import
closure"*. That was true; the obstacle it names is **one** `Oka` module and **zero** Mathlib
modules, since `Mathlib.RingTheory.LocalRing.MaximalIdeal.Basic` is already reached through
`Oka/Weierstrass.lean`. Paying it here is what lets
`LocalOkaRing.coeff_single_one_ofMvPolynomial` be stated beside `LocalOkaRing.ofMvPolynomial`
rather than behind `Oka.Completion` and `Oka.RingTheory.Flat.Descent`, which the germ-of-a-
polynomial line has no other reason to import.

The consumer of `LocalOkaRing.coeff_single_one_ofMvPolynomial` is
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimpleZeroPolynomial.lean`, which restates
`ComplexAnalytic.bijective_stalkMap_comp_uliftProj_of_coeff` and its three siblings with the
coefficient replaced by `MvPolynomial.pderiv`.

## Main definitions

- `LocalOkaRing.ofMvPolynomial y`: the germ at `y` of the holomorphic function defined by a
  polynomial.

## Main results

- `LocalOkaRing.constantCoeff_ofMvPolynomial`: the constant term of the germ at `y` is the
  value `MvPolynomial.eval y p`, with `LocalOkaRing.constantCoeff_coe_ofMvPolynomial` its
  `simp` normal form. In particular the germ is a unit exactly when `p` does not vanish at `y`,
  which is what identifies the zero set of a family of polynomials with the points where their
  germs are non-units.
- `LocalOkaRing.coe_ofMvPolynomial_zero`: **at the origin the germ of a polynomial is the
  polynomial**, read as a power series, with `LocalOkaRing.ofMvPolynomial_zero_X` the case of a
  variable that its proof runs on.
- `LocalOkaRing.coeff_single_one_ofMvPolynomial`: **the linear coefficient of the germ at `y` is
  a partial derivative of `p` at `y`.** It is what turns the simple-zero hypothesis of the stalk
  isomorphism of a hypersurface — one Taylor coefficient of a germ — into the derivative
  condition a caller holding a polynomial actually has; which statement that is, and where, is in
  the paragraph above and in this declaration's own docstring rather than here, since it is not a
  result of this file.
- `LocalOkaRing.ofMvPolynomial_taylorAlgHom`: **the germ at `y` is the germ at the origin of the
  shifted polynomial** `p(x + y)`. Since `LocalOkaRing ι` is the germ ring at the origin by
  construction, this is what lets a statement about germs at `y` be transported to one about
  germs at the origin, and it is a statement about *polynomials* only in that both sides are
  spelled with `LocalOkaRing.ofMvPolynomial`.

`LocalOkaRing.constantCoeff_apply` is itself a `simp` lemma, so `simp` rewrites

`constantCoeff_ofMvPolynomial`; tagging that lemma `@[simp]` therefore does nothing. This is the

The germ at `y` is by definition the Taylor series at the origin of the translate of the
function (`OkaRing.germ`), and translating the *function* attached to `p` is reading the shifted
*polynomial* `p(x + y)` as a function — which is `MvPolynomial.eval_taylorAlgHom`. So no analysis
is involved: the two ingredients are `OkaRing.germ_shift`, which moves the base point, and
`OkaRing.germ_restrict`, which crosses from `(⊤ : Opens (ι → ℂ)).shift y` back to `⊤`. -/

Both sides are `ℂ`-algebra maps out of `MvPolynomial`, so this is `MvPolynomial.algHom_ext` and
the value at a variable. It is what makes the local ring of `𝔸^ι` at the origin, the germ ring
and the formal power series comparable: all three agree on polynomials. -/

/-! ### The linear coefficient of the germ is a partial derivative -/

/-- **The coefficient of `xᵢ` in the germ at `y` of a polynomial is `∂p/∂xᵢ` evaluated at `y`.**

Four rewrites and **no analysis at either end**: the base point moves to the origin by
`LocalOkaRing.ofMvPolynomial_taylorAlgHom`, where the germ *is* the shifted polynomial by
`LocalOkaRing.coe_ofMvPolynomial_zero`; `MvPolynomial.coeff_coe` crosses from the power series to
the polynomial; and `MvPolynomial.coeff_single_one_taylorAlgHom` reads the shifted polynomial's
linear coefficient as a derivative. In particular no derivative operator on `LocalOkaRing` is
constructed or needed, and there is still none — the derivative here is Mathlib's
`MvPolynomial.pderiv`, on polynomials.

This is what puts the hypothesis of `ComplexAnalytic.bijective_stalkMap_comp_uliftProj_of_coeff`
into the form a caller who holds a polynomial actually has; see
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimpleZeroPolynomial.lean`. -/
