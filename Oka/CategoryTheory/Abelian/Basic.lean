# Generating an object from a kernel and a lift

Material for `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Abelian/Basic.lean`; see `README.md` on the mirror tree.

`CategoryTheory.Abelian.epi_biprod_desc_kernel_ι` is the categorical form of the elementary
statement that if `π : P ⟶ B` is surjective and `F ⟶ P` hits generators of `B`, then `F`
together with `ker π` generates `P`. It is the step that turns "an extension of two objects of
finite type is of finite type" from a plausible claim into a proof, and nothing about finite
generation appears in it.

/-- **If `u ≫ π` is an epimorphism and `π` is an epimorphism, then `u` and the kernel of `π`
jointly cover the source of `π`.**

Elementwise: if every element of `B` is `π` of something and is already hit by `u ≫ π`, then
every `p : P` differs from something in the image of `u` by an element of `ker π`. -/
