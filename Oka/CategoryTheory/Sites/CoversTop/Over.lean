# A family covering the top object covers the top of every slice

Material for `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Sites/CoversTop/Over.lean`; see `README.md` on the mirror
tree. It imports its target and `Mathlib.CategoryTheory.Sites.Spaces`, the latter only for
`TopologicalSpace.Opens.coversTop_over` below, so upstreaming it adds **15** modules to that
file's closure of **997**.

Mathlib's file of that name has `CategoryTheory.GrothendieckTopology.CoversTop.over`, which is a
*transitivity* statement: a family covering the top, refined by a family covering the top of each
member's own slice, covers the top. The lemma here travels the other way, and it is the one a
localisation argument reaches for: a single family covering the top of `C` already covers the top
of `Over W`, for **every** `W` at once, by taking every object of `Over W` whose underlying object
admits a morphism to some member of the family.

The index type is `(i : I) × (V : C) × (V ⟶ X i) × (V ⟶ W)` and not a family of pullbacks, so no
limits are assumed of the site and no choice is made. The price is a family far larger than
necessary, which `CategoryTheory.GrothendieckTopology.CoversTop` does not mind: it asks only that
the sieve generated over each object be covering.

Its consumer here is `Oka/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/Coherent/Locality.lean`, where the
kernel of a morphism out of a free sheaf has to be seen to be of finite type over every slice of a
covering family.

## The second lemma, and why it is here rather than beside the topology it mentions

`TopologicalSpace.Opens.coversTop_over` is the same phenomenon for the site of open subsets of a
topological space: a family of opens covering `X` covers the terminal object of the slice site
over `X`. It is not a special case of `CoversTop.over'` — that one produces the family of *all*
objects admitting a morphism to a member, and this one keeps the given family, which is what a
consumer holding a concrete cover has.

The type it is most specifically about is `Opens.grothendieckTopology`, defined
in `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Sites/Spaces.lean`, and that is the placement the subject suggests and
**the price rules out**: adding `Mathlib.CategoryTheory.Sites.Over` to that file costs it **193**
modules on a closure of 818, against `README.md`'s recorded 96, where the two imports it needs
here cost **15**. `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Sites/Over.lean` would cost 16 and would do as well;
this file wins by a point and by sitting beside its sibling.

It was in the root namespace until taxis #933 — inherited from `Oka/Coherent.lean`, now deleted,
which had no `namespace` at all — and is now `TopologicalSpace.Opens.coversTop_over`, the
namespace of the type its first explicit argument has, so that a caller holding an open `X`
writes `X.coversTop_over`. Two other names were weighed and rejected, and the reasons are worth
keeping because neither is obvious.

*A name in the `CoversTop` namespace*, beside the sibling above, would look like dot notation and
never be usable as such: `CategoryTheory.GrothendieckTopology.CoversTop.over'` is dot notation on
a `CoversTop` **hypothesis**, and this lemma takes no `CoversTop` argument at all.

*A name in the namespace where Mathlib keeps the topology itself* would sit the lemma beside
`Opens.grothendieckTopology` at the price of the dot notation — and that namespace is **not** the
type's. `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Sites/Spaces.lean` opens a root-level `namespace Opens`, so the
topology's full name is `Opens.grothendieckTopology` while the type's is
`TopologicalSpace.Opens`; no declaration of the topology exists under the latter, which was
checked in the environment rather than inferred. Following that would copy a Mathlib
inconsistency rather than the type. This repository already uses `namespace TopologicalSpace.Opens`
in `Oka/Topology/Category/TopCat/Opens.lean` and `Oka/StructureSheaf.lean`.

## Main results

- `CategoryTheory.GrothendieckTopology.CoversTop.over'`
- `TopologicalSpace.Opens.coversTop_over`, whose consumer is
  `Oka/Geometry/RingedSpace/LocallyRingedSpace/Coherent.lean`, where the open cover of a locally
  ringed space on which relations are locally generated has to be read on the slice site.
