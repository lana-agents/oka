# Non-vacuity of finiteness for morphisms of complex analytic spaces

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFinite` says a morphism is closed with finite fibres. Two things
could be wrong with it and neither is visible from its type: it could hold only for the
isomorphisms, and it could hold for everything. This file rules both out on the same pair of
spaces, with the two morphisms between `ℂ` and `ℂ²` that everyone draws first.

* **`ComplexAnalytic.axisIncl`, `z ↦ (z, 0)`, is finite** and is not an isomorphism — its image is
  the first axis, a proper closed subset. It is finite because its underlying map is a closed
  embedding (`ComplexAnalytic.isClosedEmbedding_base_axisIncl`), which is proved here rather than
  quoted, because `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_isCutOutBy` has no instance to be
  applied at. `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy` is a condition on a morphism of *locally ringed
  spaces*, and cut-out data is produced — that is what
  `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isCutOutBy_zeroLocusSubspaceι` does — but never for a
  morphism of *analytic* spaces:
  `git grep 'IsCutOutBy.*toLRSHom'` over the whole repository returns two hits,
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.mono_of_isCutOutBy` and `isFinite_of_isCutOutBy` itself, and both
  take it as a hypothesis. So a witness has to be built by hand.
* **`ComplexAnalytic.proj`, `(z, w) ↦ z`, is not finite, and fails *both* conditions.** Its fibre
  over the origin is the second axis, which is infinite; and its underlying map is not closed,
  because the hyperbola `z w = 1` is closed in `ℂ²` and its image is `ℂ ∖ {0}`, which is not
  closed in `ℂ`. So the example does not separate the two halves of the definition — it fails at
  both — and `ComplexAnalytic.not_isClosedMap_base_proj` is what says so.

## The third statement, which is the reason both are here

**`ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_axisIncl_comp_proj`: the composite `ℂ ⟶ ℂ² ⟶ ℂ` is finite although
the second factor is not.** So the finite morphisms are *not* closed under right cancellation, and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_comp` is not an iff in disguise. Without this the two
statements above would only say that the class is somewhere between empty and everything; this
says the composition lemma has the strength it claims and no more.

## The stalk half of `IsLocalIso`, which is the other reason this file exists

**`ComplexAnalytic.isIso_stalkMap_sq`: every stalk map of the squaring map of `ℂ ∖ {0}` is an
isomorphism.** `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso` has two fields, and until this statement
no declaration anywhere had had to check the second one: the only positive witness was the
identity, and the non-example `ComplexAnalytic.axisIncl` fails the *topological* field alone. So
the class had a field nothing exercised.

`ComplexAnalytic.sq` is the map that exercises it, and it is **not** an isomorphism
(`ComplexAnalytic.not_isIso_sq`), so the field is doing work rather than coming along for free.
The content is `ComplexAnalytic.isIso_stalkMap_okaMapHom` in
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/StalkLocalInverse.lean` — the stalk map of a holomorphic map is precomposition
of germs, so an analytic local inverse makes it bijective — applied at Mathlib's local inverse of
`z ↦ z²`. Nothing here builds a branch of the square root, and the *only* use of the puncture is
that `2z ≠ 0`.

**With the topological field — `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalHomeomorph_base_sq`, from Mathlib's
`isCoveringMap_npow` — and finiteness, this assembles into
`ComplexAnalytic.isFiniteEtale_sq`.** That is the statement the two rungs were for: a finite étale
morphism which is **not** an isomorphism, so `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale` is
strictly larger than the isomorphisms and neither rung is idle.

**And it is where the third rung is exercised.**
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoveringMap_base_of_isFiniteEtale`
(`Oka/AnalyticSpace/CoveringMap.lean`) says a finite étale morphism out of a Hausdorff analytic
space has a covering map for its underlying map; `ComplexAnalytic.isCoveringMap_base_sq` is the
only place it is applied, and the only place at which its hypotheses are shown to be satisfiable
by anything other than an isomorphism. **It proves nothing new about `z ↦ z²`** — Mathlib's
`isCoveringMap_npow` already covers that, and is what the local-homeomorphism field above is
derived from — so read it as a test of the rung and not as a fact about the map.

## Why this file imports `OkaTest/HolomorphicMapOpen.lean`

`OkaTest/` wrote the punctured `z`-line **twice**: `ComplexAnalytic.punctured` below, as
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.nonvanishing` of the coordinate, and `punctured` in
`OkaTest/HolomorphicMapOpen.lean`, as `{z | z (ULift.up 0) ≠ 0}` with its openness proved by
hand. **They are not a name clash** — the full names differ, so both can be in scope at once —
but they are one open set written twice, and until this import nothing in the tree said so.
`ComplexAnalytic.punctured_eq_punctured` below is that statement; it is `Opens.ext` and `Set.ext`
over the two `mem_punctured_iff`s and nothing else.

**The edge runs in this direction because the two closures are one-sided.** Transitive closure of
each file's import list, counting modules under `Oka/`, `OkaTest/` and `Mathlib/`, read off
`(← getEnv).header.moduleNames` in a `lake env lean` scratch whose imports are that list:

* **this file, 3690 → 3691**, and the one is `OkaTest.HolomorphicMapOpen` itself: `import Oka` is
  that file's entire import list and this file already has it, so the edge adds no third-party
  module at all;
* **`OkaTest/HolomorphicMapOpen.lean`, 3639 → 3691** for the reverse edge, since it would acquire
  `OkaTest.FiniteMorphism` itself together with `OkaTest.HolomorphicMap`,
  `Mathlib.Analysis.Normed.Module.Connected`, `Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.Polynomial.Basic` and
  their closures. **It is the one figure of the four that a build of this branch cannot produce**:
  measured there it reads 3692, because this file's olean now carries the edge and
  `OkaTest.HolomorphicMapOpen` joins its own closure. It was taken on `master`'s oleans, before
  the edge existed.

**One against fifty-two.** Neither figure is a *build* cost: `lakefile.toml`'s
`globs = ["OkaTest", "OkaTest.+"]` builds every module under `OkaTest/` already — the second
entry does that on its own, and the first is there so that the root module is built too, for the
reason the comment above it gives — so `lake build` runs the same 4041 jobs on both sides and the
edge buys ordering rather than work. **What it does cost is incremental rebuilds**: this file is
now behind `OkaTest/HolomorphicMapOpen.lean` in the order, and an edit to that file invalidates
this one.

**Two alternatives were priced and lost.** A third file importing both would cost one new module
and one line in `OkaTest.lean`, and would put the equality where neither consumer is; and
*retiring* one definition is not reachable in the cheap direction, since
`OkaTest/HolomorphicMapOpen.lean` would have to take the fifty-two-module edge to use
`ComplexAnalytic.punctured`. Retiring `ComplexAnalytic.punctured` instead *is* reachable once the
edge above exists, and it is a rename across four files. **What decides against it is the test a
retirement has to pass**, not its size: the surviving definition must discharge every use of the
one that goes, and both definitions have a use the other does not. Both therefore stand, and both
earn their keep: this one composes with
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.mem_nonvanishing_iff` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftRestrict`, and the other's `mem_punctured_iff` is `Iff.rfl`,
which `punctured_ne_top` uses definitionally.

**What the edge is for.** `OkaTest/HolomorphicFamily.lean` reaches this file through
`OkaTest/OpenBaseProjection.lean`, so it now sees `invCoord` and `not_restrict_eq_invCoord` —
*no entire function restricts to `1/z₀`* — with no import of its own, and with the two
`punctured`s reconciled. That file's `## What is not checked here` says what is still missing
around them, which is a parametrisation and a lemma and not bookkeeping.

## What is not checked here

* **Nothing about structure sheaves.** `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFinite` is a condition on
  the underlying map, and the theorem that makes it a condition on sheaves — that `f_*𝒪_X` is
  coherent for finite `f` — is not in this repository. So no statement here is about coherence and
  none should be read that way.
* **`ComplexAnalytic.axisIncl` is not shown to be a closed immersion**, only a closed embedding on
  points. Whether it cuts `ℂ` out of `ℂ²` by the second coordinate — the `IsCutOutBy` statement —
  is not proved, and only the topological half is used.
* **No compactness, and no properness beyond what finiteness gives.** The bullet that used to
  stand here said neither map was shown proper. It was written when this file's two maps were
  `ComplexAnalytic.axisIncl` and `ComplexAnalytic.proj`, so name them rather than counting them:
  **`ComplexAnalytic.axisIncl` and `ComplexAnalytic.sq` are proper** — by
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isProperMap_base_of_isFinite`, as
  `ComplexAnalytic.isProperMap_base_axisIncl` and `ComplexAnalytic.isProperMap_base_sq` — **and
  `ComplexAnalytic.proj` is not** (`ComplexAnalytic.not_isProperMap_base_proj`). What is still not
  here is any properness argument that does not go through finiteness: no source is shown compact,
  and no fibre is shown compact other than by being finite. The one fibre this file says anything
  else about is `ComplexAnalytic.proj`'s over the origin, and what it says is that it is **not**
  compact (`ComplexAnalytic.not_isCompact_fiber_proj`). There is still no `IsProper` class for a
  morphism of analytic spaces to be an instance of.
* **No finite étale morphism other than an isomorphism.** `ComplexAnalytic.axisIncl` is finite and
  is *not* a local isomorphism (`ComplexAnalytic.not_isLocalIso_axisIncl`), which is what says the
  second rung restricts the first; but the only positive witness for
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale` here is **no longer** the identity, and the two
  bullets that used to stand here are retired rather than weakened. `ComplexAnalytic.sq`, the
  squaring map of the punctured line, is proved finite (`ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_sq`), a local
  homeomorphism (`ComplexAnalytic.isLocalHomeomorph_base_sq`), an isomorphism on every stalk
  (`ComplexAnalytic.isIso_stalkMap_sq`) and **not** an isomorphism
  (`ComplexAnalytic.not_isIso_sq`) — hence `ComplexAnalytic.isFiniteEtale_sq`, a finite étale
  morphism which is not an isomorphism. **The stalk half of
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso` is exercised by it**, and by nothing else: the
  non-example `ComplexAnalytic.axisIncl` fails the topological field alone.
* **A `degree` function on morphisms — this is no longer absent, and this file is where it is
  checked.** The bullet that used to stand here said two things, and **both are now retired**:
  that the constancy of the number of sheets over a connected base was not proved anywhere — it
  is, `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.card_fiber_eq_of_isFiniteEtale`, applied here as
  `ComplexAnalytic.card_fiber_sq_eq` — and that nothing showed `ComplexAnalytic.sq` two-sheeted,
  which `ComplexAnalytic.card_fiber_base_sq` now does. So the constancy statement has a witness
  whose common value is **2** rather than something a one-sheeted map would also satisfy, and the
  bullet's complaint that it was a weak test is answered.
  **The `Nat`-valued `degree` function this bullet said was not wanted now exists** and is
  exercised here: `ComplexAnalytic.degree_sq` reads `ComplexAnalytic.card_fiber_base_sq` as
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree ComplexAnalytic.sq = 2`, and
  `ComplexAnalytic.not_bijective_base_sq` is the one application of
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.bijective_base_iff_degree_eq_one`. What answered the objection was
  not the computation but the pair of statements in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Degree.lean` — the
  well-definedness theorem and a consumer of the number — and the computation here is what stops
  that pair from being exercised at nothing.
  **The distinction the bullet before that one drew still holds**: `IsCoveringMap` is a condition
  on a map of topological spaces, so neither `ComplexAnalytic.isCoveringMap_base_sq` nor Mathlib's
  `isCoveringMap_npow` is about a covering *of analytic spaces*, a notion this repository does not
  have.

Embedding by `Function.LeftInverse.isEmbedding` at `ComplexAnalytic.axisRetract` — a continuous

/-- **And so it is not proper**, since a proper map is closed (`IsProperMap.isClosedMap`).

`ComplexAnalytic.proj` fails `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFinite` for two independent
reasons — an infinite fibre and a non-closed underlying map — and **`IsProperMap` sees both**.
The fibre over the origin is not compact (`ComplexAnalytic.not_isCompact_fiber_proj`) and the
underlying map is not closed (`ComplexAnalytic.not_isClosedMap_base_proj`), and either failure
on its own refutes properness.

What is *not* the case is that properness tests the finiteness of a fibre. It asks for
compactness, so `ComplexAnalytic.infinite_fiber_proj` — a statement about cardinality — does not
refute it, which is why the fibre route needs the theorem above and not that one. The proof
shipped here takes the closedness route because it is one line. -/

/-! ### The composite, and what it says about the composition lemma -/

/-- **The composite `ℂ ⟶ ℂ² ⟶ ℂ` is the identity on points.**

Composition of morphisms of analytic spaces is composition of the underlying morphisms of locally
ringed spaces by definition, so the left-hand side is `base_proj` after `base_axisIncl`, and a
point of `ℂ` is determined by its one coordinate. -/

/-- **The composite is finite although the second factor is not.**

So `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_comp` cannot be strengthened to an equivalence, and
finiteness is not right-cancellable: with `ComplexAnalytic.not_isFinite_proj` this is a pair
`f`, `g` with `f ≫ g` finite and `g` not. -/

/-- **And the composite in the other order is not finite**, which is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_isFinite_comp` read contrapositively at a second
factor that is injective and is not the identity.

The pair is `ComplexAnalytic.proj`, which `ComplexAnalytic.not_isFinite_proj` says is not finite,
and `ComplexAnalytic.axisIncl`, which `ComplexAnalytic.isClosedEmbedding_base_axisIncl` makes
injective — so the cancellation lemma forbids the composite from being finite. **Together with
`ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_axisIncl_comp_proj` this pins down which order matters**: the same two
morphisms compose to a finite map one way round and to a non-finite one the other, and the
difference is exactly that `ComplexAnalytic.proj` is the *first* factor here and the second one
there. Nothing about the fibres or the topology is computed below; the whole proof is the lemma. -/

/-! ### Finite is not finite étale

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale` is `IsFinite` together with
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso`, and the second is a real restriction: the witness this
file already has is finite and is **not** a local isomorphism. -/

/-- **The inclusion of the first axis is not a local isomorphism.**

A local homeomorphism is an open map, so its range would be open; the range is also closed, since
the inclusion is a closed embedding. `ℂ²` is connected, so a clopen subset is `∅` or everything —
and the range is neither, being nonempty and not all of `ℂ²`
(`ComplexAnalytic.not_surjective_base_axisIncl`).

**Nothing about stalks is used**: the topological field alone fails. That is worth saying, because
it means the example does not exercise
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso.isIso_stalkMap` — `ComplexAnalytic.isIso_stalkMap_sq`
is what does, and it is a different map. -/

This is the degenerate witness. It is kept because it is the cheapest possible check that

the *only* one: the non-degenerate witness is `ComplexAnalytic.isFiniteEtale_sq` below, `z ↦ z²`
from `ℂ ∖ {0}` to itself, which needed `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftRestrict`, a
covering-map statement from Mathlib and a germ dictionary to state. **Neither witness makes the

larger than the isomorphisms. -/

/-! ### The squaring map of the punctured line, and its stalk maps

The limitation this file used to record — that the only positive witness for
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale` was the identity — was about `ℂ ∖ {0}` and `z ↦ z²`,
and **this section builds that map**; the two after it prove everything the witness needs, and
`ComplexAnalytic.isFiniteEtale_sq` at the end retires the limitation. It is
here because the construction was the part nobody had priced: a morphism whose *target* is an open
subspace needed `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftRestrict`, which did not exist.

This section proves that the map exists, what its underlying map is, and that it is **not
injective** and hence not an isomorphism. The next proves it **finite** and a **local
homeomorphism**; the one after that proves every one of its **stalk maps is an isomorphism**; and
`ComplexAnalytic.isFiniteEtale_sq` at the end assembles them. -/

The two topological halves of the witness. **Neither of them is about stalks**; the stalk field of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso` is the section after this one, and
`ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_sq` puts them together.

Both halves go through one bridge — `ComplexAnalytic.puncturedHomeo`, which identifies the
underlying space of the punctured line with `{z : ℂ // z ≠ 0}` — and then quote Mathlib about
`x ↦ x ^ 2` on the nonzero elements of `ℂ`. **The analysis is not done here and was not written
here**: `isCoveringMap_npow` is Mathlib's, and `isClosedMap_npow` and `finite_fiber_npow` are in
`Oka/Analysis/Complex/CoveringMap.lean`, stated for an arbitrary proper normed field because
nothing in them is complex-analytic. -/

/-! ### The stalk maps of the squaring map are isomorphisms

This is the field of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso` that nothing in this repository
had ever had to check. The mathematics is Mathlib's — `AnalyticAt.analyticAt_localInverse` says
the local inverse of an analytic function with nonvanishing derivative is analytic — and the work
is the germ dictionary in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/StalkLocalInverse.lean`, which turns such a local
inverse into an isomorphism of stalks.

**The other field is the section above**, and the two are assembled in
`ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_sq` at the end of the file. -/

`ULift.up 0`; that is used in both directions below and is why no `Equiv` with `ℂ` is needed. -/

`eventually_sq_sqRoot` transported along evaluation, which is continuous.

/-- **The stalk maps of `ComplexAnalytic.sq` are isomorphisms**, at every point of `ℂ ∖ {0}`.

This is the stalk field of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso` for a map that is **not** an
isomorphism (`ComplexAnalytic.not_isIso_sq`), which is what the field had never been made to do.

It is `isIso_stalkMap_sqAll` transported across the factorisation
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftRestrict_fac`, by
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isIso_stalkMap_liftRestrict`: the target is an open
subspace, whose inclusion is an isomorphism on stalks, so the lift and the morphism it factors
have the same stalk maps up to isomorphism. Nothing about the *subtype* topology of `ℂ ∖ {0}` is
used — the only role of the puncture is `deriv_sqFun_ne_zero`.

**Three things are written out rather than left to be inferred, and each one is load-bearing.**
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isIso_stalkMap_liftRestrict` is applied positionally,
because leaving its instance to search leaves the range hypothesis undetermined. The other two are
about the *spelling* of a point and of a composite, and each was measured by deleting it:

* the `haveI` states `isIso_stalkMap_sqAll` at
  `((… ).ofRestrict punctured).toLRSHom.base x` and **not** at `x.1`. The two are `rfl`-equal —
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.base_ofRestrict` is `rfl` — and with the `haveI` left to infer
  its type from the `x.1` form, the `hcomp` below fails with `failed to synthesize`;
* `hcomp`'s type is written out rather than left to `inferInstance` under the `▸`: with the
  `haveI` at the right spelling but `hcomp` replaced by `he ▸ inferInstance`, the same
  `failed to synthesize` comes back at the same composite.

Why is not established here and **no explanation should be read into this note**; what reproduces
is the two deletions above. The general shape is the one that recurs across this repository — two
`rfl`-equal terms are different discrimination-tree keys, and writing out *the right one of the
two* is the fix rather than writing out a type at all.

The `▸` transports a `IsIso`, which is a `Prop`, so it moves a proof and no data and nothing
downstream can meet a stuck `Eq.mpr`. -/

/-! ### The witness, assembled

Everything above is a separate statement about `ComplexAnalytic.sq`; this is the one sentence they
were for. **`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale` now has a positive witness other than
the identity**, and `ComplexAnalytic.not_isIso_sq` says it is not an isomorphism, so the class is
strictly larger than the isomorphisms.

Neither field is proved here — `IsLocalIso`'s two fields are
`ComplexAnalytic.isLocalHomeomorph_base_sq` and `ComplexAnalytic.isIso_stalkMap_sq`, and
`IsFiniteEtale`'s other field is `ComplexAnalytic.isFinite_sq`. -/

/-- **`ComplexAnalytic.sq` is a local isomorphism.** Its two fields are the two preceding
sections. -/
theorem isLocalIso_sq : AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso (ComplexAnalytic.sq.{u}) where
  isLocalHomeomorph := isLocalHomeomorph_base_sq.{u}
  isIso_stalkMap x := isIso_stalkMap_sq.{u} x

/-- **`ComplexAnalytic.sq` is finite étale, and it is not an isomorphism.**

This is what `OkaTest/FiniteMorphism.lean` existed to be unable to say. With
`ComplexAnalytic.not_isIso_sq`, `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale` is now known to
contain something the isomorphisms do not — which is the whole claim `ComplexAnalytic.axisIncl`
could not make, since it fails the local-isomorphism condition rather than satisfying it.

**Its underlying map is a covering map**, which is the section below: the third rung,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoveringMap_base_of_isFiniteEtale`, consumes exactly this
theorem. That was the clause this docstring used to have to withhold. It remains a statement about
the underlying map and not about the structure sheaves. -/
theorem isFiniteEtale_sq : AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale (ComplexAnalytic.sq.{u}) where
  isFinite := isFinite_sq.{u}
  isLocalIso := isLocalIso_sq.{u}

/-! ### The witness is a covering map: the third rung, exercised

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoveringMap_base_of_isFiniteEtale` in
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/CoveringMap.lean` says the underlying map of a finite étale morphism out of a
Hausdorff analytic space is a covering map. This is the only place it is applied.

**Nothing here is new about `ComplexAnalytic.sq`, and the section would be misread if that were
not said.** That `z ↦ z²` is a covering map of `ℂ ∖ {0}` is Mathlib's `isCoveringMap_npow`, which
is already what `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalHomeomorph_base_sq` above is derived from; conjugating it
with `ComplexAnalytic.puncturedHomeo` would give the conclusion below in two lines and without the
rung. What is tested here is the **rung** — that its hypotheses are the ones a witness in this
repository actually has, and that its conclusion follows from `ComplexAnalytic.isFiniteEtale_sq`
with no further input about `sq` beyond the separation of its source.

**Only the underlying map is a covering map.** `IsCoveringMap` is a condition on a map of
topological spaces, so `ComplexAnalytic.isCoveringMap_base_sq` says nothing about structure
sheaves; there is no notion of a covering *of analytic spaces* in this repository, and the stalk
field of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso` plays no part in the third rung. -/

/-- **The punctured line is Hausdorff.** `ComplexAnalytic.puncturedHomeo` again: `{z : ℂ // z ≠ 0}`
is a subspace of `ℂ`.

An analytic space carries no separation axiom — `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Basic.lean` declines to impose
one, as `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme` does — so this is a hypothesis of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoveringMap_base_of_isFiniteEtale` that has to be supplied here.

Declared as an instance rather than a theorem so that the application below is one line. Its head
is a particular restriction of a particular space, both defined in this file, so it cannot fire
anywhere it is not wanted, and there is no competing `T2Space` instance for an analytic space to
disagree with. -/

    T2Space ((AnalyticSpace.complexAffineSpace.{u} 1).restrict punctured.{u} : Type u) :=
  puncturedHomeo.{u}.symm.t2Space

/-- **The underlying map of `ComplexAnalytic.sq` is a covering map**, from
`ComplexAnalytic.isFiniteEtale_sq` and the third rung.

This is the first — and so far only — application of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoveringMap_base_of_isFiniteEtale` at anything other than an
isomorphism, so it is what says the rung is not vacuous. It is *not* independent evidence that
`z ↦ z²` covers the punctured line: see the section docstring. -/
theorem isCoveringMap_base_sq :
    IsCoveringMap ((ComplexAnalytic.sq.{u}).toLRSHom.base :
      ((AnalyticSpace.complexAffineSpace.{u} 1).restrict punctured.{u} : Type u) → _) :=
  haveI := isFiniteEtale_sq.{u}
  AnalyticSpace.isCoveringMap_base_of_isFiniteEtale ComplexAnalytic.sq.{u}

/-- **The punctured line is preconnected.** `ComplexAnalytic.puncturedHomeo` again: the statement
is about `{z : ℂ // z ≠ 0}` and the bridge carries it.

`ℂ ∖ {0}` is connected because `ℂ` has real rank `2 > 1`
(`isConnected_compl_singleton_of_one_lt_rank`, with `Complex.rank_real_complex`), which is the
only place in this file where a *dimension* of `ℂ` is used at all — everything else about
`z ↦ z²` goes through `Oka/Analysis/Complex/CoveringMap.lean` and is stated over an arbitrary
proper normed field. **That is why the statement is false for the punctured line over `ℝ`** and
why no attempt is made to state it there.

Declared as an instance for the same reason `ComplexAnalytic.t2Space_restrict_punctured` is: its
head is a particular restriction of a particular space, both defined in this file, so it cannot
fire anywhere it is not wanted. `PreconnectedSpace` rather than `ConnectedSpace` because that is
what `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.card_fiber_eq_of_isFiniteEtale` asks for; the space is of
course also nonempty, and nothing needs that.

**The transport is `Homeomorph.connectedSpace_iff`, which is a transport of `ConnectedSpace` and
not of `PreconnectedSpace`.** The `Homeomorph` namespace has no `PreconnectedSpace` transport to
match the `Homeomorph.t2Space` that `ComplexAnalytic.t2Space_restrict_punctured` just above uses,
and that is a real gap; it costs nothing here, because the connectedness of `ℂ ∖ {0}` arrives as
`ConnectedSpace` in the first place and only becomes `PreconnectedSpace` at the last step, on this
side of the bridge. Naming the absent `PreconnectedSpace` transport in backticks would fail this
repository's docstring-name check, which is the check working: a declaration that does not exist
should not be spelled as though it did. -/

/-- **All fibres of `ComplexAnalytic.sq` have the same number of points.**

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.card_fiber_eq_of_isFiniteEtale` at the witness, and the only place
that theorem is applied. Its three hypotheses are all supplied in this file:
`ComplexAnalytic.isFiniteEtale_sq`, `ComplexAnalytic.t2Space_restrict_punctured` and
`ComplexAnalytic.preconnectedSpace_restrict_punctured`.

**This used to be a weak statement and the paragraph here said so**, because the common value was
not computed and nothing ruled out its being `1`. `ComplexAnalytic.card_fiber_base_sq` below
computes it, and it is `2`, so the hypotheses of the constancy statement are now satisfied at a
morphism where the conclusion is not what an isomorphism would give. **This theorem is kept and is
not made redundant by that one**: what it exercises is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.card_fiber_eq_of_isFiniteEtale`, and a witness for a general theorem
is not retired by a stronger fact about the witness. It remains the only place that theorem is
applied.

`Nat.card` is not a junk value, because `ComplexAnalytic.finite_fiber_base_sq` gives finiteness —
see `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.card_fiber_eq_of_isFiniteEtale`'s docstring, where that is the
reason the homeomorphism form is stated alongside. -/
theorem card_fiber_sq_eq (y₁ y₂ : (AnalyticSpace.complexAffineSpace.{u} 1).restrict

  haveI := isFiniteEtale_sq.{u}
  AnalyticSpace.card_fiber_eq_of_isFiniteEtale ComplexAnalytic.sq.{u} y₁ y₂

/-- **Every fibre of `ComplexAnalytic.sq` has exactly two points**, so the squaring map of the
punctured line is a genuinely two-sheeted cover.

This is what `ComplexAnalytic.card_fiber_sq_eq` above does *not* say. That theorem says all fibres
have the same cardinality; this one computes it, and the value is not `1`, so the constancy
statement now has a witness at which it is not the statement an isomorphism would satisfy.

**No covering-space theory is used.** The content is `IsAlgClosed.card_setOf_pow_eq` — over an
algebraically closed field `x ^ n = a` has exactly `n` solutions when `(n : F) ≠ 0` and `a ≠ 0` —
carried across `ComplexAnalytic.base_sq_eq_conj` exactly as
`ComplexAnalytic.finite_fiber_base_sq` carries `finite_fiber_npow`. The two shuffles are the same
one and `Equiv.subtypeEquiv` does the second half, because a homeomorphism's preimage of a set is
in bijection with that set by the underlying equivalence and nothing topological is wanted.

`Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.Polynomial.Basic` is imported by this file for `Complex.isAlgClosed`
alone, and `Oka` does not bring it in. **The way that was established is worth recording, because
the obvious instrument gets it wrong.** A breadth-first search over `import` lines that does not
mask comments reports that module as reachable from `Mathlib/Analysis/Complex/CoveringMap.lean` —
through `Mathlib.Tactic.FunProp`, whose *documentation* shows an example `import` line, which is
not an import. Masked, it is not reachable; and the compiler agrees, since without this import
`IsAlgClosed ℂ` fails to synthesize with `failed to synthesize instance of type class
IsAlgClosed ℂ`. See `Oka/FieldTheory/IsAlgClosed/Basic.lean` for the measurement.

**This did not retire the `degree` clauses, and something else has.** The sentence that used to
stand here said all four places recording the absence of a `Nat`-valued degree function still
recorded it, and that was right at the time: one theorem about one map is not an invariant. What
retired them is `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Degree.lean`, which supplies the well-definedness theorem
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_eq_card_fiber` and a consumer,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isHomeomorph_base_of_degree_eq_one`; this theorem is what
`ComplexAnalytic.degree_sq` reads, and it is unchanged by that. -/

worth stating: the degree is an `iSup` over the target, so over an empty target it is `0` whatever

is used here, exactly as none is used in `ComplexAnalytic.card_fiber_base_sq`.
