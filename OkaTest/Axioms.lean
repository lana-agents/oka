# Axiom regression test

The library is `sorry`-free, and its results rest only on the three standard axioms of Lean:
`propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`. A `sorry` is only a warning, not an error, so
nothing in an ordinary `lake build` would notice if one were reintroduced — the proof of a
theorem depending on it would simply start depending on `sorryAx` as well.

The files imported above pin that down: each `#guard_msgs` in them fails the build if the axiom
dependencies of the named theorem ever change. Together with the `sorry` grep in
`.github/workflows/lean_action_ci.yml` that is what keeps the completeness claim in `README.md`
honest.

These files are not part of the `Oka` library; they are the `OkaTest` library of
`lakefile.toml`, whose `globs = ["OkaTest.+"]` picks up every module under `OkaTest/` and which
`defaultTargets` also builds, so plain `lake build` exercises them. Adding a file under
`OkaTest/Axioms/` therefore needs no change to `lakefile.toml`. The layout follows Mathlib's own
`MathlibTest`: a test library must live in a directory of its own, outside the source tree of
the library it tests, or Lake rejects its imports.

## Where to put a new assertion

**Add it to the file for its topic, under the matching `/-! ### … -/` heading, and if there is
no such file, add a new one and one import line here. Never append to whichever file you
happened to open.**

| topic | file |
| --- | --- |
| Oka's theorem and the coherence of `𝒪_X` | `OkaTest/Axioms/MainTheorem.lean` |
| Weierstrass division and preparation | `OkaTest/Axioms/Weierstrass.lean` |
| complex analysis in one and several variables | `OkaTest/Axioms/Analysis.lean` |
| `LocalOkaRing`: Rückert, maximal ideal, regularity | `OkaTest/Axioms/LocalOkaRing.lean` |
| `OkaRing` and the structure sheaf of `ℂ^ι` | `OkaTest/Axioms/ComplexSpace.lean` |
| the comparison morphism to `Spec` | `OkaTest/Axioms/Analytification.lean` |
| general presheaf and sheaf theory | `OkaTest/Axioms/Sheaves.lean` |
| sheaves of modules and coherence | `OkaTest/Axioms/SheafOfModules.lean` |
| zero loci and closed immersions | `OkaTest/Axioms/CutOut.lean` |
| analytic spaces, local models, the node | `OkaTest/Axioms/AnalyticSpace.lean` |
| morphisms of analytic spaces | `OkaTest/Axioms/Morphisms.lean` |
| general commutative ring theory | `OkaTest/Axioms/RingTheory.lean` |

That rule is the whole point of the split, and it is not a matter of taste. Until 2026-08-20
every assertion lived in this one file and every pull request appended to its end, so git
reported a conflict between *any* two concurrent pull requests: only one could merge per rebase
round, and each of the others needed a rebase, a force-push, a re-`attach_pr` and a fresh
review of a tree whose library files were byte-identical to the one already approved. That cost
four such cycles in a single morning. Issue #558's append-at-the-end convention reduced the
damage but could not remove it, because two additions at the end of a file still collide.
Concurrent pull requests that touch *different files* do not. See issue #640.

## Updating an assertion

If a theorem is legitimately restated or renamed, do **not** delete its assertion. Run the
corresponding `#print axioms` (for instance with `lake env lean OkaTest/Axioms/<File>.lean`, or
in the editor) and paste the message Lean actually prints back into the expected docstring.
The expected message must stay `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`: any other axiom —
`sorryAx` above all — is a regression, not something to record.
