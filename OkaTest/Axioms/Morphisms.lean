# Axiom regression tests: morphisms of complex analytic spaces

The morphisms of analytic spaces built from holomorphic maps, the first morphism out of a
space which is not `ℂ^n`, and the classes of morphisms — finite, local isomorphism, finite étale —
together with the topological criteria they are proved from, in both directions — the criteria
that read a class off the underlying map, and the construction that produces a morphism in a
class from a covering map — and the constructions that feed those criteria a family of monic
polynomials, together with the category the finite étale ones form over a fixed base and the
cancellations that say a morphism of that category is itself finite étale. Two sections are of a
third kind, named here because the description above does not reach them: **transports of the
local-isomorphism class along a change of source and target** — over an open subset of the
target, and to subspaces cut out by a family of global sections and by its pullbacks. Those are
`### And a local isomorphism restricted over an open of the target is one` and
`### And a local isomorphism restricted to subspaces cut out by a family and by its pullbacks`.
And a fourth kind is statements about the class of **isomorphisms**, which is not one of the
classes above; its sections are named here for the same reason.
`### An isomorphism of analytic spaces is bijective on points` reads a topological consequence
off an isomorphism and is built from no criterion and transported from nowhere;
`### A bijective base, or degree one, makes a local isomorphism an isomorphism` goes the other
way and is where a criterion concludes `CategoryTheory.IsIso`. **The sentence this replaces said
that one section was of this kind and that no section of it is built from a topological
criterion**, and `### A bijective base, or degree one, makes a local isomorphism an isomorphism`
is both — which is what retired the clause, rather than a recount. And one is of a fifth:
statements about a topological property of a cover's **total space** rather than about any class
of morphisms — that preconnectedness passes along a morphism surjective on points, and the
separation of two covers of equal degree that buys —
`### Connectedness of the total space separates two covers of the same degree`. And one section is
about no class of morphisms and no statement at all: it guards the structure
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` and the structure `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom` themselves,
and its own docstring says which paragraphs of this file rest on it —
`### The axiom is already in the structure and in the type of a morphism`.

And a sixth kind is about the **category** rather than about any morphism in it: that
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` has a terminal object, and that a pair of complex affine spaces
has a product — `### The terminal object and the product of two complex affine spaces`. **That
clause was added by the push that added that section**, which is what this paragraph's own history
says a description owes a section it does not reach. **Five further sections are of that kind
and are named here for the same reason**: that the square a restriction over an open of the target
sits in is a pullback, `### That restriction is a pullback square, and the base change it gives`;
that a pair of open subspaces of complex affine spaces has a product,
`### The product of two open subspaces of complex affine spaces`; that a pair of local models has
one, `### The binary product of two local models`; that a cospan one of whose legs is finite
étale with Hausdorff source has a **fibre product**,
`### Base change of a finite étale morphism, and the fibre product it is the projection of`; and
that a cospan of local models presented by cut-out data has one,
`### The fibre product of two local models over a third`.

**Two of those five hold statements of the *first* kind as well, and are named here for the limit
and not for those.** `### Base change of a finite étale morphism, and the fibre product it is the
projection of` holds the base change of `isFiniteEtale`, in the two spellings
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_baseChangeSnd` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_pullback_snd_of_isFiniteEtale`, and
`### That restriction is a pullback square, and the base change it gives` holds
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_restrictHom`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_restrictHom` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_pullback_snd_ofRestrict`. The description above does
reach each of those five; what it does not reach is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isPullback_baseChange`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isPullback_ofRestrict`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isPullback_fibreProdCutOut`,
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isPullback_ofRestrict`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isPullback_map_ofRestrict`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isPullback_pullbackFst_ofRestrict`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isPullback_map_pullbackFst_ofRestrict` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isPullback_map_pullback_pullbackFst_ofRestrict`, together with the
six `HasPullback` guards `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasPullback_of_isFiniteEtale`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasPullback_ofRestrict`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasPullback_ofRestrict'`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasPullback_ofCutOut`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasPullback_pullbackFst_ofRestrict'` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasPullback_map_ofRestrict`, each of which is
*a claim about a limit and not about a class* in the words
`### That restriction is a pullback square, and the base change it gives` uses of itself.

**That clause read *the four `HasPullback` guards* and named four of them, until 2026-09-07**,
when `Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackOpen.lean` gained an instance at a cospan one of whose legs is a
base change of an open-subspace inclusion. **The boundary of the clause, said rather than left to
be discovered**: it names the `isPullback_` guards and the `HasPullback` guards, and it does not
name the guards that *identify* such a limit with an object presenting it — the ones in this file
whose name carries `IsoProd`, `IsoPullback`, or, since the same push,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictIsoPullbackOfRestrict` with its `_hom_fst`. Those are
claims about a limit too and the description at the head of this file does not reach them either;
widening the sentence to cover them is a push of its own.

**That clause named three of this file's `#print axioms` statements of a pullback square, until
2026-09-07**, when it was brought level with the file and named all eight. It was exact when
written and went stale twice without anything on this board seeing it: the push that stated that
square in `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace` added two such guards and did not extend the
clause, and this push adds three more at the cospan a glue datum's transition maps open over.
**The clause names rather than counts, which is what this file's own rule asks for and is also
what lets it go stale in silence** — the check is to list this file's `#print axioms` names whose
declaration name contains *isPullback* and compare that list against the clause.

**It read *the five `HasPullback` guards* and named five of them, until 2026-09-07**, when
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackOpen.lean` gained an instance stating that pullback in
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace` rather than in `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`. The clause
is about the guards of this file and not about the category they are stated in, so the sixth
belongs in it; the boundary drawn for the guards whose name carries `IsoProd` or `IsoPullback` is
unchanged by that push.

**This sentence was added by the push that added
`### Base change of a finite étale morphism, and the fibre product it is the projection of`**,
2026-09-07, and `### That restriction is a pullback square, and the base change it gives`,
`### The product of two open subspaces of complex affine spaces` and
`### The binary product of two local models` went unnamed in this paragraph until then.
**It said *three* and left `### That restriction is a pullback square, and the base change it
gives` out, which was false when written rather than falsified later** — that section predates the
push by which this paragraph acquired the sentence, and the sentence's own criterion reaches it,
since the section calls itself a claim about a limit and the new one borrowed that phrase to place
itself. So this is a correction and not one of this repository's dated records.

**The sentence said *Four* and named four sections, and the sentence opening *Two of those five
hold statements of the first kind as well* said *those four* and *the three `HasPullback`
guards*, until 2026-09-07**, when
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/CutOutFibreProduct.lean` added
`### The fibre product of two local models over a third` — a fifth section of this kind, a second
`CategoryTheory.IsPullback` statement the description does not reach, and a fourth `HasPullback`
guard. The three figures were exact when written and are the ordinary shape of a count over the
sections of this file, which any push adding one falsifies.

**The fourth kind has a second class, and it is the monomorphisms.**
`### A monomorphism of covers is injective on points, and the summand that follows` reads a
topological consequence off a class of morphisms which is not one of the classes the opening
description lists, exactly as the two isomorphism sections do, and the class it reads it off is
`CategoryTheory.Mono` rather than `CategoryTheory.IsIso`. **That is true of three of that
section's four `Prop` guards and not of the fourth**, which mentions no monomorphism and is
reached by this description's naming of the finite étale class; that section's own docstring says
which guard is which and why. **That clause was added by the push that
added that section**, 2026-09-07, for the reason the clause naming
`### The terminal object and the product of two complex affine spaces` gives. Its three
non-`Prop` guards — the fibre product of a morphism of covers with itself and that object's two
projections — are of the **first** kind instead, by the description's clause *the category the
finite étale ones form over a fixed base*, and the limit they come from is guarded under
`### Base change of a finite étale morphism, and the fibre product it is the projection of`.

And a seventh kind is of the **mirror tree**, and is a kind of routing rather than a kind of
subject: two statements of pure topology, in neither of which an analytic space occurs — that a
covering map stays a covering map under base change along a *continuous* map, and that the fibres
of the base-changed map stay finite — under
`### Base change of a covering map, and of its finite fibres`. `OkaTest/Axioms.lean` routes a
mirror-tree module whose subject no row of its topic table names to the file of the analytic
result that motivated it; that result here is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_coveringSpaceHom`, which asks for a covering map and for
finite fibres as two separate hypotheses, and the section's own docstring gives that routing and
says what does and does not consume the two statements. **The guards this file carried from
`Oka/Topology/Covering/Basic.lean` before that section arrive by the same routing and needed no
clause of their own**: each of them shares a section with a `ComplexAnalytic` guard and sits under
that statement's heading — `### The third rung: a finite étale morphism is a covering map`,
`### The number of sheets, constant over a preconnected base` and
`### Cancellation of finiteness and of finite étaleness`. This one shares its section with no
`ComplexAnalytic` guard and its heading names no analytic object, so no clause above reaches it.
**This clause was added by the push that added that section**, 2026-09-07, for the reason the
clause naming `### The terminal object and the product of two complex affine spaces` gives.

And one kind more, and it is neither a class of morphisms nor a routing: statements about a
morphism's underlying map being — or failing to be — a **separated map**, and about the separation
axiom on its source that a separated map into a Hausdorff target gives. `IsSeparatedMap` is
`Mathlib/Topology/SeparatedMap.lean`'s and is none of the classes the opening description lists;
it is not a field of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale` and a morphism can be finite
étale without it, which is what
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.not_isSeparatedMap_doubledLineOver` says. The section is
`### Separatedness of a cover's structure morphism, and the summand it makes free`, and the clause
reaches all of its guards except three: `…FiniteEtaleOver.isFiniteEtale_left_of_isSeparatedMap` is
of the **first** kind, by the opening description's clause naming the cancellations that make a
morphism of the category of covers finite étale, and
`…FiniteEtaleOver.injective_base_left_of_mono_of_isSeparatedMap` together with
`…FiniteEtaleOver.inducesIsoOnDirectSummand_of_mono_of_isSeparatedMap` are of the **fourth**, by
the clause opening *The fourth kind has a second class, and it is the monomorphisms*. **This
clause was added by the push that added that section**, for the reason the clause naming
`### The terminal object and the product of two complex affine spaces` gives.

And another kind is the **transition data** of a construction over this category: not a class of
morphisms, not a statement that a cospan has a fibre product, and not a statement about a class at
all, but the objects and morphisms a gluing of fibre products is assembled from and the laws they
satisfy — `### The transition data of a fibre product glued over a family of opens`. **The sixth
kind's criterion does not reach it**: that kind is *a cospan has a fibre product*, and no guard of
this section says any cospan has one; every one of them takes the fibre products it names as a
hypothesis. **Five** of its twenty-seven guards are of a further kind again — statements about
**morphisms of locally ringed spaces** rather than about morphisms of analytic spaces, between the
images of analytic ones: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.isOpenImmersion_map_fV`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.isoPullbackFV`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.t'Map`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.t'Map_cocycle` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.t'Map_snd`. The section's own docstring argues that routing
against the topic table of `OkaTest/Axioms.lean` rather than assuming it. **This clause was added
by the push that added that section**, 2026-09-08, for the reason the clause naming
`### The terminal object and the product of two complex affine spaces` gives.

**The sixth kind has a second category, and it is a subcategory of the first.**
`### The category of separated covers, and separatedness as a morphism property` guards
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtale.lean`, which cuts the covers separated over the base out
of the covers by intersecting `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale` with a second morphism
property. **Five of that section's twenty-one guards are of this kind** — about the category
rather than about any morphism in it — and they are
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver` itself, its inclusion into the covers
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.toFiniteEtaleOver`, the base over itself
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.id`, and that object's terminality in the
two forms `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isTerminalId` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.hasTerminal`. **The other sixteen are of
kinds this description already has and none needs a clause of its own**; that section's docstring
assigns every one of them by name, and the split is seven of the kind opening *And one kind more*,
five of the first, two of the fourth and two of the mirror tree. **This clause was added by the
push that added that section**, 2026-09-08, for the reason the clause naming
`### The terminal object and the product of two complex affine spaces` gives.

And a further kind, next to the separated-map one and distinct from it: statements about the
**image** of a morphism's underlying map — where that map lands as a set, and not which class the
morphism is in. `### The image of an open-subspace inclusion, and of a base change of one` holds
both of this file's, and they are declarations of two different modules:
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.range_base_ofRestrict`, of `Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenSubspace.lean`,
and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.range_base_pullbackFst_ofRestrict`, of
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackOpen.lean`. **The sixth kind's criterion does not reach the second of
them**, even though its subject is a projection out of a fibre product: that kind is *a cospan has
a fibre product*, and this says where a projection out of one lands rather than that the limit
exists — the limit it is about is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasPullback_ofRestrict`'s, which
that clause already names. **This clause was added by the push that added that section**,
2026-09-08, for the reason the clause naming
`### The terminal object and the product of two complex affine spaces` gives.

**Named rather than counted from the end**, which is the repair and not the description. **The
sentence this replaces called them *the last two***; they stopped being that when two further
sections were appended past them — and one of those two was written across two lines, so no
count of this file could see it and the claim went stale without leaving a trace anything could
find. **That
is the best argument for the heading check `.orchestra/validation.sh` now runs**: not a wrong
number, which a recount repairs, but a positional claim in an append-at-end file that nothing
was able to contradict.

**Naming a section does not protect the name against being rewritten.** The fourth kind's pointer
at `### An isomorphism of analytic spaces is bijective on points` said
`### An isomorphism of analytic spaces is surjective on points` until the branch that
renamed that heading to its present form — the same file and the same push — left the pointer
behind, and the same sentence said *a* statement where the section holds two. **Nothing mechanical
sees either half**: the heading check above asks that a heading be written on the line that opens
its doc comment and not that anything cite it, and `scripts/check_docstring_names.py` resolves
backticked *declaration* names, which a heading is not. So this is a third failure mode of the
same sentence — not stale by position and not stale by count, but naming something that no longer
exists — and the repair for it is the one the sections themselves use: quote the heading as it is
written.

See `OkaTest/Axioms.lean` for what these assertions are for and how to update one.

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/ProjectionStalk.lean`. The heading above records when a stalk map is an
isomorphism; these record what one particular stalk map *is*, which is what a quotient statement
about `LocalOkaRing` needs before it can be read as a statement about a morphism of spaces. The
`coordEmb` three are the general statement, for the map `ℂ^ι → ℂ^κ` forgetting the coordinates
outside an embedding `κ ↪ ι`; the `projCoords` group is its instance at `Fin.castSuccEmb`, and
the `uliftProj` pair is the same projection between complex analytic spaces, where the
coordinates are indexed by `ULift (Fin n)` and the germ rings have to be relabelled to reach
`LocalOkaRing.incl`. The two `…_apply` guards are the germ statements read at an arbitrary
element of the stalk, which is the form `Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimpleZeroStalk.lean` consumes. The
last **four** are the definitions the whole group is about, in file order:
`ComplexAnalytic.coordEmb`, `ComplexAnalytic.projCoords`, `ComplexAnalytic.uliftCastSuccEmb` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.proj`. -/

/-! ### The third rung: a finite étale morphism is a covering map

`IsClosedMap.isCoveringMap_of_isLocalHomeomorph` and `IsCoveringMap.isClosedMap` are mirror-tree
topological criteria in `Oka/Topology/Covering/Basic.lean` and say nothing about analytic spaces;
they are guarded here rather than apart from their consumers. They are converse to one another,
and `IsCoveringMap.isClosedMap` is the one
`### A covering space of a complex analytic space is a complex analytic space` uses — that
section's own docstring names it and says which half of its statement it supplies.

**`4025f01` wrote both clauses this replaces, and they have not aged the same way.** *"The first
two"* selected the two criteria named above, was exact when written and is exact now, so it is
replaced rather than deleted. *"only the second is used by the heading at the foot of this
file"* was also exact at `4025f01`, where
`### A covering space of a complex analytic space is a complex analytic space` **was** the last
heading of this file and consumes `IsCoveringMap.isClosedMap` and not its converse; headings have
been appended past it since, so the clause is false today. **A positional pointer can go false
while every numeral in the sentence beside it stays exact**, which is why the repair names the
section rather than moving the pointer.

**`IsSeparatedMap.t2Space` is a third mirror-tree statement guarded here, and it is routed by
this heading rather than by a row of `OkaTest/Axioms.lean`'s topic table.** It is in
`Oka/Topology/SeparatedMap.lean`, whose subject — separated maps — no row of that table names, so
it falls under the tail that file describes: *"Guard one in the file of the analytic result that
motivated it, under that result's heading."* What motivated it is
`IsClosedMap.isCoveringMap_of_isLocalHomeomorph`'s `[T2Space E]`: composed with Mathlib's
`IsCoveringMap.isSeparatedMap` it is what turns a non-Hausdorff total space into a refutation of
that criterion, which is `LineTwoOrigins.not_isCoveringMap_fold_of_not_t2Space` in
`OkaTest/FiniteEtaleCancel.lean`. **The witness itself is not guarded**, for the reason the
section `### Base change of a covering map, and of its finite fibres` gives of
`TwoIndiscrete.not_isCoveringMap_pullback_snd_of_not_continuous` — *"this file imports `Oka` and
not `OkaTest`, so no declaration of a test file is in its environment"*. What is guarded here is
the library lemma that witness consumes. -/

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SimpleZeroStalk.lean`. The stalk half of *the analytification of a standard
étale morphism is a local isomorphism*: the two headings above supply what a stalk map of a
projection *is* and when a stalk map is an isomorphism, and these join them to
`LocalOkaRing.quotientSimpleZeroEquiv`. `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.mem_ker_stalkMap_iff` is the
kernel of a one-section cut-out and `ComplexAnalytic.bijective_stalkMap_comp_of_incl` is the whole
proof with both identifications taken as arguments;
`ComplexAnalytic.bijective_stalkMap_comp_projCoords` and
`ComplexAnalytic.bijective_stalkMap_comp_uliftProj` are its `Fin` and `ULift (Fin _)` instances,
each with its `IsIso` form beside it. `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.evalHom_eq_zero` is that every
cutting section vanishes at every point of the subspace it cuts out, which is what makes the
vanishing half of the hypothesis below free rather than asked for, and the `…_of_coeff` results
after it are the same conclusion from one Taylor coefficient of the germ rather than from the
order. -/

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenBaseProjection.lean` and
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenBaseProjectionPolynomial.lean`, together with
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictHom` from `Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenSubspace.lean`, which is
what makes the projection over `V` a restricted morphism. The two headings above are the same two
halves over the whole of `ℂ^(n+1)`; these carry both across the restriction, in all three
spellings of the simple-zero hypothesis — an order, one Taylor coefficient, and a derivative of a
polynomial.

**The restriction is of the base**, `V ⊆ ℂ^n` with `ComplexAnalytic.cylinder V` its preimage. A
standard étale algebra also inverts a polynomial, and that polynomial involves the fibre variable,
so `D(G)` is cut out of the *source* and is a cylinder only in the special case where `G` does
not. **The source restriction is no longer missing and its guards are the `####` subsection
below**, which is why this paragraph no longer sends a reader elsewhere for it; the two
restrictions stay different and neither subsumes the other. **This sentence ended by naming what
`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleAnalytification.lean` *"still records as absent"* — the
`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy` datum for a presentation's `k + 1` relations — and that file no
longer records it as absent**: the count was right and the reading of it was wrong, `k + 1`
against one being the signature of a statement whose base is the whole of `ℂ^n`, and at `k = 0`
the datum is `ComplexAnalytic.isCutOutBy_analytificationInclHom_hypersurface`
(`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleLocalIso.lean`). Still untouched is any statement at
`k ≥ 1`. -/

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/CoveringSpace.lean`. The converse of *the third rung* above, at the level of
the spaces and not only of the maps: a local homeomorphism into an analytic space makes its source
one, and a covering map with finite fibres makes it finite étale. `IsCoveringMap.isClosedMap`,
guarded under that heading, is what supplies the second half — the closed base map that finite
fibres do not give. It is not the only mirror-tree topology the construction consumes: the cover

The restricted statements below are the transport of the two halves across an open subspace of the
*hypersurface*, which three module docstrings recorded as absent until taxis #1112. They are
guarded together and apart from the unrestricted ones above because the asymmetry is the content:
the stalk half is already quantified one point at a time and transports by composition, while the
topological one is not reached from its own unrestricted form and goes through
`isLocalHomeomorph_coordProj_comp_of_isEmbedding_inter` above — which is itself a corollary of
the theorem guarded above it, so **nothing here rests on a statement the tree did not already
have**. -/

/-! ### Cancellation of finiteness and of finite étaleness

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_comp_of_t2Space` is in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Finite.lean`
beside the fibre half it completes, and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_of_comp` is in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalIso.lean`,
which is where `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale` is declared. Neither uses a covering
map: the `[T2Space]` of both is on the middle space and is spent in the first, through Mathlib's
proper-map cancellation.

`IsCoveringMap.isClosedMap_of_comp` is the **fourth** `IsCoveringMap` statement guarded in this
file — after `IsCoveringMap.isClosedMap`, `IsCoveringMap.eventually_nonempty_homeomorph` and
`IsCoveringMap.nonempty_homeomorph_fiber` above — and the only one that is a *cancellation*. It
is mirror-tree material that nothing in this repository consumes, which is why it is guarded here
and named nowhere else: an unconsumed declaration is exactly the one whose disappearance nothing
else would catch.

The witness that the `[T2Space]` of the two analytic statements cannot be dropped is
`TwoIndiscrete.not_isClosedMap_pt_of_isClosedMap_comp` (`OkaTest/FiniteEtaleCancel.lean`) and is
**not** guarded here: this file imports `Oka` and not `OkaTest`, so no declaration of a test file
is in its environment. -/

`ComplexAnalytic.isClosedEmbedding_base_restrictHom_of_subset_range` read through

immersion needs — finite over an open subset of its image while not finite at all.

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenSubspace.lean`. Its own section rather than an addition to the one above,
because that header enumerates the two statements under it and a third appended silently would
make the header false — which is the failure this file's section docstrings are most exposed to,
since they assert the state of the repository and a sweep over `Oka/` does not reach them.

**Read it against `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_restrictHom_of_subset_range` directly
above**: that one needs `V` inside the image because finiteness is not local on the target, and
this one needs nothing at all because both fields of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso` are conditions at a point. It is the second field of
`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleFiniteEtale.lean`'s `IsFiniteEtale`, whose guards are in
`OkaTest/Axioms/Analytification.lean`.

/-! ### That restriction is a pullback square, and the base change it gives

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackOpen.lean`. `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictHom` is guarded in
this file as a *construction* — at
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_restrictHom_of_subset_range` and at
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_restrictHom`, each a transport of a class along a change
of source and target. This section guards the statement that the square that restriction sits in
is a **pullback**, which is a claim about a limit and not about a class, and appended as its own
section because a section moved is a conflict for somebody else.

**`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_pullback_snd_ofRestrict` is guarded here as a test
of an instance and not only of a theorem's axioms**, which is worth saying because a
`#print axioms` line does not usually carry that. Its statement mentions
`CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback` at `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`, which does not elaborate at
all unless `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasPullback_ofRestrict` is found by instance search — so
an instance that existed at a discrimination-tree key search does not reach would leave the guard
for it unbuildable rather than green. That seam is a recorded hazard in this corner of the
tree: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isIso_stalkMap_ofRestrict`'s docstring exists for one
instance of it.

**`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_restrictHom` is not the sibling it looks like.**
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_restrictHom_of_subset_range` hypothesises an embedding and
an open subset inside the image, and concludes about a morphism that is not finite; this one
hypothesises finiteness and asks nothing of the open subset. `Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackOpen.lean`'s
header says why neither implies the other.

**That square read as an identification, and the one cospan orientation it makes legal, are
guarded here rather than in a section of their own**, because the sentence above — *the statement
that the square that restriction sits in is a pullback, which is a claim about a limit and not
about a class* — reaches them as written, and a section appended for guards an existing
description already covers buys a heading and nothing else.
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictIsoPullbackOfRestrict` is that square's pullback property
read as an identification of the limit, which `CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPullback` discards; the
instance is at the cospan order Mathlib's `CategoryTheory.IsPullback.instHasPullbackFst` does not
reach, and **that file states no instance at the order Mathlib does reach**, which its own
docstring records as measured rather than assumed.

**`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.pullback_condition_pullbackFst_ofRestrict` is guarded here as a
test of an instance and not only of a theorem's axioms**, which is the same double duty
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_pullback_snd_ofRestrict` carries and is worth saying
for the same reason. Its statement mentions
`CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback (CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback.fst f (Y.ofRestrict V)) k`, so it
does not elaborate unless
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasPullback_pullbackFst_ofRestrict'` is found by instance search —
an instance sitting at a key search does not visit would leave this guard unbuildable rather than
green, and that statement was measured `failed to synthesize` at `a84398c`, the commit before the
one that adds the instance.

**Two declarations of `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace` are guarded here, and the routing is
`OkaTest/Axioms.lean`'s — but not that file's rule for a module its topic table leaves unrouted,
whose premise fails here.** `Oka/Geometry/RingedSpace/OpenImmersion.lean` *is* routed: the row
`general presheaf and sheaf theory, and ringed spaces` names its subject, and
`OkaTest/Axioms/Sheaves.lean` guards
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion.isoOfRangeEq`,
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion.range_pullback_to_base_of_left` and
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.restrictLE` out of it, under headings that name the module
by path. So the tail rule is the wrong citation and the module is not in that tail.

**What places them is the practice `OkaTest/Axioms.lean` states as *"Guard one in the file of the
analytic result that motivated it, under that result's heading"*, which that file records as
having two independent precedents — one of them `OkaTest/Axioms/AnalyticSpace.lean` reaching that
placement for a module the sheaves row *does* route.** This module is that case and was before
this push: `OkaTest/Axioms/AnalyticSpace.lean` guards
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.liftRestrict`,
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.liftRestrict_uniq`,
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.hom_ext_restrict`,
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isOpenImmersion_ofRestrict` and
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.restrictInfIsoPullback` out of it beside the analytic
statements they serve, and this file already guards
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isIso_stalkMap_liftRestrict`. Guarding
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isPullback_ofRestrict` and
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.range_subset_preimage_of_pullbackCone` here is that same
practice at that same module, one heading over.

`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isPullback_ofRestrict` and its cone lemma
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.range_subset_preimage_of_pullbackCone` say nothing about
analytic spaces, and what motivated them is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isPullback_map_ofRestrict` — the statement that
the square this section is about stays a pullback square after
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.forgetToLocallyRingedSpace`. That statement is guarded here, so
they are guarded here. The section's own description — *a claim about a limit and not about a
class* — reaches them as well, but it is not what places them.

**What this paragraph does not take.** `OkaTest/Axioms.lean` says of a routed module guarded
elsewhere that it *"is a different question from a module no row routes"*, and that its own
paragraph does not take that question. Neither does this one: nothing here says whether guards
placed this way belong in the unrouted-tail figure that file measures, and the guards this push
adds from that module are offered to no tally of it.

**`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.toLRSIsoPullbackMap` is the second guard in this section that
tests an instance and not only a theorem's axioms.** Its *type* names
`CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback (ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.forgetToLocallyRingedSpace.map f)
(ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.forgetToLocallyRingedSpace.map (Y.ofRestrict V))`, so it does not
elaborate unless `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasPullback_map_ofRestrict` is **found**; that
statement was measured `failed to synthesize` at `ebba2ce`, the commit before the one that adds
the instance, and green at the commit that adds it. A `def` is the one shape for which this test
is not optional, since a call-site `haveI` cannot be reached while a type is being elaborated.

**Three of the guards below are at the cospan a glue datum's transition maps open over**, whose
two legs are `CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback.fst` at open-subspace inclusions rather than the
inclusions themselves: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isPullback_pullbackFst_ofRestrict`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isPullback_map_pullbackFst_ofRestrict` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isPullback_map_pullback_pullbackFst_ofRestrict`. **They need no
routing argument**: all three are declarations of `Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackOpen.lean` in the
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` namespace, which is what this section is for, and the push that
added them adds nothing to the mirror tree. That is a change from the push before it, which added
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isPullback_ofRestrict` and
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.range_subset_preimage_of_pullbackCone` here and argued that
placement in the paragraph headed *Two declarations of `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace` are
guarded here*.

/-! ### And a local isomorphism restricted to subspaces cut out by a family and by its pullbacks

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/CutOutLocalIso.lean`, the whole of it, in the order they are declared. The
sibling of the section directly above and appended as its own for the same reason that one gives:
that header enumerates what its file had when it was written, and a guard appended into it would
make it false silently.

**Two of the guards below ask nothing of the morphism the class is transported along.**
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.stalkMap_Γgerm_pullbackΓ` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.range_base_of_isCutOutBy_pullbackΓ` hold for an arbitrary morphism
of analytic spaces; `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isOpenMap_base_of_isCutOutBy_pullbackΓ` asks
only that its base map is open. The `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso` hypothesis is
spent by `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalHomeomorph_base_of_isCutOutBy_pullbackΓ`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.bijective_stalkMap_of_isCutOutBy_pullbackΓ` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_of_isCutOutBy_pullbackΓ` alone. **Every guard below is
a theorem.**

**That clause read *the last three*, and the paragraph directly above it is the argument against
writing one.** This section exists apart from its sibling because that sibling's header
*"enumerates what its file had when it was written, and a guard appended into it would make it
false silently"* — and a selector reaching this section's own guards from the end fails on the
same append, one paragraph after the sentence that says so. `2b2591e` wrote it, and this section
held the same guards in the same order then, so it was exact at birth and has stayed exact; it
selects, so it is replaced by the names rather than deleted.

**`git log -S` could not date that clause, and quoting it on one line here is what makes it
findable.** Before this commit the string *is spent by the last three alone* occurred in no blob
of this file: it wrapped a source line, and a fixed-string search does not span the newline, so
the search reports a clause that has been present since `2b2591e` as never having existed. **A
revision walk that whitespace-normalises each blob before searching is what dates one.** And the
quotation above is the first time the phrase sits on a single line, so the search that returned
nothing will now return this commit and nothing earlier — the opposite of a provenance, and worth
knowing before anyone quotes its output.

/-! ### Surjectivity of a finite local isomorphism over a connected base

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalIso.lean`, appended as its own section for the reason the sections above
give: a section moved is a conflict for somebody else.

The guards below read the two rungs against each other and nothing else — a local isomorphism is
an open map and a finite morphism is a closed one, so over a preconnected base the image of a
non-empty source is everything. The contrapositive is the one with a consumer:
`ComplexAnalytic.not_isFinite_condEtaleProj` (`OkaTest/StandardEtaleNotFinite.lean`) is where the
unrestricted standard étale morphism is refuted by a missing point, and that consumer is a test
declaration and so is **not** guarded here — this file imports `Oka` and not `OkaTest`, which is
the reason the cancellation section above gives for the same omission. -/

/-! ### A property of the restriction over `⊤` is a property of the morphism

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictHom f V` is a morphism between two *other* spaces, so a
statement about it is not on its face a statement about `f`. At `V = ⊤` the two inclusions are
isomorphisms and the property transfers, which is what lets a `V` hypothesis be **refuted** rather
than only left unproved: a morphism that is not finite étale now gives
`¬ ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale` of its own restriction over `⊤` by contraposition,
and likewise for `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFinite`. **The finiteness half is the one the
two `## What is not here` bullets elsewhere were about**, since both name a finiteness theorem; it
lives in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenSubspace.lean` because `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFinite` is
not a `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty` here and needs no part of this file.

**Appended as its own section**, for the reason the sections above give. The open-subspace
statements underneath these — `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.mono_ofRestrict`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftTop_ofRestrict`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isIso_ofRestrict_of_eq_univ`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isIso_liftTop` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftTop_comp_restrictHom_top` — are guarded in
`OkaTest/Axioms/AnalyticSpace.lean`, with the constructions that build a space rather than with the
classes of morphisms, and so is the one definition they are stated about,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftTop`. **Listed rather than counted**, because a list is
falsified by a missing entry and a numeral by any addition anywhere.

/-! ### An isomorphism of analytic spaces is bijective on points

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Basic.lean`, appended as its own section for the reason the sections above
give: a section moved is a conflict for somebody else.

**Not the same statement as the one under `### Surjectivity of a finite local isomorphism over a
connected base`**, which is the section this is most easily confused with. That one reads
surjectivity off *two* classes — a local isomorphism is open, a finite morphism is closed — and
needs a preconnected base and a non-empty source. This one is the categorical fact and needs
nothing: an inverse exists, so the base has a right inverse. **The section is named and not
located**, because it is not the section immediately above this one and counting would say it was.

Its consumers spend it in the contrapositive, to turn a non-surjectivity into a `¬ IsIso`, and
they are **not all `Oka/`'s** — which is what decides whether each of them is guarded here.
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.not_isIso_sigmaι` (`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Sigma.lean`) is the library's,
and is guarded in `OkaTest/Axioms/AnalyticSpace.lean` beside the disjoint union's other statements;
`ComplexAnalytic.not_isIso_lineRefineToBase` (`OkaTest/RefineDatumUnitFamily.lean`) is a test
declaration and so is **not** guarded here — this file imports `Oka` and not `OkaTest`, which is
the reason the `### Cancellation of finiteness and of finite étaleness` section gives for the same
omission.

**Guarded here rather than in `OkaTest/Axioms/AnalyticSpace.lean`, and the reason is the subject
and not the module.** That file's `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Basic.lean` guards are all
`ComplexAnalytic.IsCLinearHom` statements sitting under its gluing heading; its own docstring sends
the *classes* of morphisms here, and `CategoryTheory.IsIso` is one. The sibling above,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.surjective_base_of_isLocalIso_of_isFinite`, is guarded here for the
same reason and is declared in a different module again.

**Two statements, and the second is the first's `.surjective`.**
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.bijective_base_of_isIso` is where the homeomorphism and every
caveat above now live; `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.surjective_base_of_isIso` is a projection of
it and is kept because a non-surjectivity is the shape that refutes an `IsIso`. Both are guarded,
because both are advertised under `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Basic.lean`'s `## Main results` and a guard
of a corollary does not guard what it is a corollary of — the axioms of the projection could in
principle be a strict subset. Here they are not, and the two blocks below say so. -/

/-! ### The degree does not see a change of source, and is an invariant of a cover

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_comp_of_bijective_base` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_isIso_comp` (`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Degree.lean`), and the
degree of an object of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver` that they buy
(`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`), appended as their own section for the reason the
sections above give: a section moved is a conflict for somebody else.

**Guarded here and not with the `### The finite étale covers of a fixed base, as a category`
section above, although the declarations below are drawn from that section's own file
(`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`) as well as from `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Degree.lean`.** The
subject of every one of them is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree`, which is a function of a
*morphism* and belongs to this file by the topic table's `morphisms of analytic spaces` row; the
category section above is about the objects and their separation by `¬ IsIso`, and none of its
guards reads a fibre.

**Named by file rather than counted**, and this paragraph said *"four of the seven declarations
are that file's"* instead — both numerals wrong of the section as it stands. The repair is not a
recount: a census of an append-at-end section goes stale on the next append and nothing mechanical
reads it, which is the same reason this file's module docstring names its sections rather than
counting them from the end.

**And this section's opening sentence went on counting after that repair landed**, which is worth
recording because of *why* nothing caught it. It read *"`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Degree.lean`'s two
statements about precomposition"* — a **genitive** rather than an article and a numeral, so the
sweeps that reached the paragraph above reached past it: an article-and-numeral pattern does not
match a possessive, and this shape is what taxis #1712 filed. `2ba7cb6` wrote it, and that file's
`## Main results` advertised exactly the two now named under a single bullet then and does now, so
the numeral selected rather than totalled and the names replace it.

**Which set that numeral was of is `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Degree.lean`'s *advertised* results, and
naming the set matters because a near neighbour of it gives a different answer.** That file also
advertises `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_comp`, the multiplicativity of the degree in a
composite, so a reader counting its advertised results **about composition** rather than about
*pre*composition would not arrive at the pair now named.

**`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Degree.lean`'s older advertised results are still unguarded**, exactly as
they were before this section existed — `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_eq_card_fiber`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_id`, `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_sigmaFold`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.bijective_base_iff_degree_eq_one` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isHomeomorph_base_of_degree_eq_one`, which
`scripts/guard_coverage.py --by-file` prints by name under that file. That is neither a regression
nor a repair: **a branch guards what it adds**, the whole-file figure it leaves behind is
whatever the sum is, and retro-guarding five declarations a branch does not touch is a separate
and purely mechanical job. The list above is by name and not by count, so nothing in it goes
stale when one of them is guarded. -/

/-! ### Connectedness of the total space separates two covers of the same degree

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Basic.lean`'s transport of preconnectedness along a morphism surjective on
points, and the statements of `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean` it buys: that
preconnectedness of the total space is an invariant of an object, the contrapositive that
separates two objects by it, that a trivial cover with two distinct sheets is disconnected, and
the two composed.

**Appended as its own section rather than added to either of the two it draws from**, for the
reason the sections above give — a section moved is a conflict for somebody else — and because
the subject is neither of theirs. `### An isomorphism of analytic spaces is bijective on points`
is about the class of isomorphisms and the first declaration below is stated at a surjection;
`### The degree does not see a change of source, and is an invariant of a cover` is about
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree`, and the whole point of this section is the separation that
degree cannot make.

**Named by file rather than counted**, as the section above says and for the reason it gives.

**`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.not_preconnectedSpace_sigma`, which is what the third statement
below reads, is guarded in `OkaTest/Axioms/AnalyticSpace.lean`** beside the disjoint union's other
statements, and so is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isClopen_range_sigmaι_base` under it — a
disjoint union is a space and not a morphism, which is the topic table's split.
`OkaTest/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`'s `not_iso_trivial_sqOver`, the witness at the punctured line, is a
test declaration and so is **not** guarded here: this file imports `Oka` and not `OkaTest`, the
same reason the `### Cancellation of finiteness and of finite étaleness` section gives for its own
omission. -/

/-! ### The fibre functor

The fibre of a cover over a point of the base, the two functors it assembles into and the values
they take, all of `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`: the fibre type, its finiteness, the
action of a morphism of covers on it, the functor into `Type u`, the functor into `FintypeCat`, the
equivalence an isomorphism of covers induces, the count against
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.degree`, and the two values — a point over the base
over itself and `ι` over the trivial `ι`-sheeted cover.

**Named by file rather than counted**, as the two sections above say and for the reason they give.

**Definitions are guarded here as well as theorems, and that is this file's existing practice
rather than a departure** — `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.okaMap` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrictLE` are among the definitions guarded in the sections above,
and this paragraph said the opposite until it was checked. A `#print axioms` on a `def` reports
what its *value* was built from, which for the two functors is the whole of the claim that they are
constructions and not a `Classical.choice` in disguise.

**`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.fiberTrivialEquiv` is `noncomputable` and is on
the same three axioms as everything else here**, so noncomputability and the axiom footprint come
apart. The modifier is forced and the reason was measured by deleting it and reading the error:
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.fiberSigmaDescEquiv` is `noncomputable`, and it is that and
not anything in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean` that the compiler stops at.

`Mathlib.CategoryTheory.FintypeCat` enters `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`'s import
closure with the second functor and is the only import that push adds; it is not guarded here
because nothing in this repository declares it. -/

/-! ### The trivial cover at one sheet is the base over itself

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`'s isomorphism of objects at an inhabited subsingleton
index type, and the two-directional statement over a non-empty base that it and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.isEmpty_iso_trivial_id` make together. Appended as
its own section rather than merged into the degree sections above: moving or reordering a section
of this file is a conflict for every branch that has appended to it.

**What the guards below are a check of is that the two directions are proved by different means.**
The forward one goes through `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.degree`, which
separates isomorphism classes and never produces an isomorphism; the backward one goes through
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.sigmaFoldIso` and the universal property of the disjoint union,
which reads no structure sheaf and no fibre. Neither is the other read backwards.

**`Classical.choice` is in every guard below and is not a surprise**: both statements mention
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.trivial`, which is built out of a gluing, and the
forward direction spends `Nat.card`.

**Named and not located.** No sentence here says which section precedes or follows it.

/-! ### Unique lifting for morphisms of covers

The rigidity statements of `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`: that two morphisms of covers
agreeing at one point of a preconnected source agree on points, the same conclusion from a point
of a fibre and from the fibre functor's action, and the endomorphism corollary.

**Appended as its own section rather than added to the section above**, for the reason the
sections above give — a section moved is a conflict for somebody else — and because the subject is
not that one's: `### The fibre functor` is about the fibre and the functors it assembles into,
where these are about what a morphism of covers is pinned down by, and only
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.base_eq_of_fiberMap_eq` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.base_eq_of_fiberFunctor_map_eq` mention a fibre at
all.

**Named by file rather than counted**, as the sections above say and for the reason they give.

**`IsCoveringMap.eq_of_comp_eq` is Mathlib's and is not guarded here**, nothing in this repository
declaring it; what the guards below check is that composing it with
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCoveringMap_base_of_isFiniteEtale` — guarded in
`OkaTest/Axioms/AnalyticSpace.lean` — introduces nothing, which is the same thing the sections
above check of their own compositions. `Classical.choice` is in every guard below and arrives with
the covering-map rung, not with anything stated here.

**Named and not located.** No sentence here says which section is above or below it; the next
branch appends between them. -/

/-! ### Faithfulness for morphisms of covers

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean` and `Oka/Geometry/RingedSpace/LocallyRingedSpace.lean`:
that a morphism of covers is determined by its base map, the unique-lifting statements guarded
above with an equality of *morphisms* rather than of maps as their conclusion, the endomorphism
corollary, and the general locally-ringed-space lemma the first of those runs on.

**`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.hom_ext_of_comp_eq` is mirror-tree material guarded here
rather than in `OkaTest/Axioms/Sheaves.lean`, which is the row that routes its file** and which
already holds `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.hom_ext_of_isEmpty` from that same file. This
is consumer-placement, which `OkaTest/Axioms.lean` records as a practice with two precedents and
which `OkaTest/Axioms/AnalyticSpace.lean` reaches for
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.hom_stalk_ext` — a declaration of the same file and the one
this lemma is built from. The reason to prefer it here is that the statements below are the whole
of why that lemma exists, and `OkaTest/Axioms/Sheaves.lean` would separate it from them. **A
later seat who disagrees moves one guard**, and nothing in this section's prose depends on where
it sits.

**`Classical.choice` is in every guard below.** It is not introduced here: it arrives with the
covering-map rung through the statements guarded above, and it is present even in
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.hom_ext_of_comp_eq` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.hom_ext_of_base_eq`, whose statements ask for no
separation axiom and no connectedness at all.

/-! ### The fibre functor is faithful, as a class, on the connected Hausdorff covers

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean` and `Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalIso.lean`: the clopen
dichotomy with `Nonempty` moved into the conclusion, the fibre it produces over a preconnected
base, the extensionality statement that needs no point of that fibre, the injectivity statements
it gives for the fibre functors, the full subcategory they are faithful on, the objects of it
named in `Oka/`, and the `CategoryTheory.Functor.Faithful` instances themselves.

**`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.surjective_base_or_isEmpty_of_isFiniteEtale` is guarded here and
not with the surjectivity statements it is a corollary of.** This file's rule is that a guard goes
in the section of the push that added it, and the whole reason that disjunction exists is the
faithfulness statements below — the surjectivity theorem it calls was already here and already
guarded. **A later seat who prefers it beside its own line moves one guard**, and no sentence here
depends on where it sits.

**`Classical.choice` is in every guard below** and is not introduced by any of them: it arrives
through the covering-map rung, exactly as the section above records, and is present even in the
`CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty` that names the subcategory.

**Named by file rather than counted**, as the sections above say and for the reason they give.

/-! ### Multiplicativity of the degree, and the divisibility it gives on covers

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree_comp` (`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Degree.lean`), the elementary
count under it and the equivalence under that (`Oka/SetTheory/Cardinal/Finite.lean` and
`Oka/Logic/Equiv/Set.lean`), and what reading it at the triangle of a
morphism of covers buys (`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`). Appended as its own section
rather than merged into `### The degree does not see a change of source, and is an invariant of a
cover` above, for the reason that section itself gives: moving or reordering a section of this
file is a conflict for every branch that has appended to it.

**The mirror-tree declarations are guarded here and not in a file of their own.**
`Set.preimageCompEquivSigma` is declared by `Oka/Logic/Equiv/Set.lean` and
`Nat.card_preimage_singleton_comp` by `Oka/SetTheory/Cardinal/Finite.lean`, neither of which has
any complex-analytic content or a `## Main results` heading of its own; the precedent for
guarding such a declaration under the topic of the statement that consumes it is the
`IsCoveringMap` guards earlier in this file, which are `Oka/Topology/Covering/Basic.lean`'s. The
subject of everything below is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.degree`, a function of a
*morphism*, which is the topic table's
`morphisms of analytic spaces` row.

**`Set.preimageCompEquivSigma` is the only guard below that is not `Classical.choice`**, and that
is the finding worth having a guard for rather than a fact about bookkeeping: splitting the fibre
of a composite into the fibres of its first factor is a construction, it assumes nothing about
either map, and the choice enters only when the pieces are *counted* —
`Nat.card_preimage_singleton_comp` manufactures a `Fintype` from a `Finite` instance and is
`Classical.choice` for that reason and not because of anything geometric. -/

/-! ### A bijective base, or degree one, makes a local isomorphism an isomorphism

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Basic.lean`, `Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalIso.lean` and
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Degree.lean`: that the forgetful functor to locally ringed spaces reflects
isomorphisms, the criterion that turns a local isomorphism with bijective base into an
isomorphism, and the two hypotheses this repository can feed that criterion — injectivity over a
preconnected base, and degree one.

**Guarded here rather than in `OkaTest/Axioms/AnalyticSpace.lean`, for the reason the section
`### An isomorphism of analytic spaces is bijective on points` gives**: the subject is a class of
morphisms and `CategoryTheory.IsIso` is one, whatever module the declaration is written in. That
file's `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Basic.lean` guards are `ComplexAnalytic.IsCLinearHom` statements under
its gluing heading, and the reflection instance is neither. **A later seat who disagrees moves one
guard**, and nothing in this section's prose depends on where it sits.

**The reflection instance is named in `Oka/` rather than anonymous, and that is what makes it
guardable at all.** An anonymous instance is given a machine-made name derived from its type, so a
`#print axioms` at one is as stable as the elaborator's spelling of that type and not as stable as
the statement. The `CategoryTheory.Functor.Faithful` instance for the same functor is anonymous
and is guarded nowhere.

**`ComplexAnalytic.IsCLinearHom.of_comp` is guarded here although it is a `ℂ`-linearity
statement.** It is the whole content of the reflection instance, and the push that wrote that
instance is what made it *advertised*: `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Basic.lean`'s `## Main results` names it
in the bullet announcing the instance and did not name it before, so `scripts/guard_coverage.py`
counts it where it did not. **A guard of a corollary does not guard what it is a corollary of** —
the axioms of the ingredient could in principle be a strict subset — which is the reason the
section `### An isomorphism of analytic spaces is bijective on points` gives for guarding a
statement and its projection separately.

**A reader looking for it elsewhere would be looking in more than one place, and that is measured
rather than assumed.** `OkaTest/Axioms/AnalyticSpace.lean` guards
`ComplexAnalytic.IsCLinearHom.eq` and `ComplexAnalytic.IsCLinearHom.of_openCover`; this file
already guards `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.isCLinearHom_lift`; and `OkaTest/Axioms/CutOut.lean`
guards `ComplexAnalytic.isCLinearHom_restrictHom`. **A later seat who prefers this one beside a
particular sibling moves one guard**, and nothing here depends on where it sits.

**`Classical.choice` is in every guard below and none of them introduces it.** The reflection
instance is `ComplexAnalytic.IsCLinearHom.of_comp` together with faithfulness, neither of which
chooses anything; the criteria inherit it through the local-isomorphism rung, and the degree form
through the covering-map theory that identifies a degree with a fibre count.

/-! ### The terminal object of the category of covers, and the two fibre functors preserve it

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`: the base over itself as a terminal object of the
category and of the full subcategory of preconnected Hausdorff covers, the two
`CategoryTheory.Limits.HasTerminal` instances that bundle those, the preservation of the terminal
object by the inclusion of that subcategory and by both fibre functors, and the value of the
`FintypeCat`-valued one at that object.

Appended as its own section rather than merged into another, for the reason the sections in this
file give for that: a section appended at the end cannot say which section is above it and stay
true, since the next branch appends between them.

**`Classical.choice` is in every guard below** and is not introduced by any of them. It arrives
through the covering-map rung, exactly as the sections about the fibre functor record, and is
present even in the `CategoryTheory.ObjectProperty` that names the subcategory.

**`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.preservesLimitsOfShape_pempty_fiberFunctor` and

are guarded with the name on a line of its own**, being too long to follow `#print axioms` inside
the character limit. That is the spelling `OkaTest/Axioms.lean` warns about in its own instrument
paragraph — a line-based `#print axioms\s+(\S+)` scan does not see a wrapped name — and the `perl`
recipe there is what reads them. Both are long because the head symbol of what they state is
`CategoryTheory.Limits.PreservesLimitsOfShape`, and naming a declaration after its conclusion is
worth a wrapped line.

/-! ### The fibre functor is conservative, on the same covers it is faithful on

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`: a morphism of covers whose fibre map at one point of the
base is bijective, the two general steps that make that statable, and the
`CategoryTheory.Functor.ReflectsIsomorphisms` instances for both fibre functors. Appended as its
own section rather than merged into
`### The fibre functor is faithful, as a class, on the connected Hausdorff covers`, for the reason
that section itself gives about a guard going in the section of the push that added it.

**Conservativity and faithfulness hold on the same full subcategory and under the same hypothesis
on the base**, which is what makes the pairing worth stating: the objects named in
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean` for the one are objects for the other, and no new
subcategory is cut out here.

**`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.isIso_of_isIso_left` is guarded although it says
nothing about fibres and nothing about finiteness.** It reflects an isomorphism along the two
forgetful functors of the comma category and would make sense at every
`CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.Over`; it is guarded here because this push is what added it and
because a guard of a corollary does not guard what it is a corollary of, which is the reason the
sections above give for guarding a statement and its consumer separately.

**`Classical.choice` is in every guard below and none of them introduces it.** It arrives through
the covering-map rung, as the faithfulness section records, and reaches even the statement that
reads no fibre: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.isEmpty_left_of_isEmpty_fiber`
goes through the clopen dichotomy. **The `[propext]`-only guard on this line is
`Set.preimageCompEquivSigma`**, in the degree section, and nothing below joins it.

**Named by file rather than counted**, as the sections above say and for the reason they give.

**Named and not located.** No sentence here says which section is above or below it. -/

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`: the disjoint union of a finite family of covers as an

that the cofan is the coproduct, the colimit-of-shape statement at an index type of the category's

/-! ### The fibre functors and finite coproducts

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`: the equivalence between the fibre of a disjoint union of
covers and the disjoint union of the fibres, the two `rfl` lemmas identifying its forward map with
each fibre functor's action on the inclusion of a member, the colimit statement for each of those
functors, the colimit-of-shape statement each is deduced to at an index type of the category's own
universe, and the `CategoryTheory.Limits.PreservesFiniteCoproducts` instance for each, which is the
Galois-category axiom on a fibre functor.

Appended as its own section rather than merged into another, for the reason the sections in this
file give for that: a section appended at the end cannot say which section is above it and stay
true, since the next branch appends between them.

**`Classical.choice` is in every guard below** and is not introduced by any of them. It is there
before any of them builds anything: `#print axioms` at `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` itself lists
it, which the section `### The axiom is already in the structure and in the type of a morphism`
guards. So it reaches every statement about an analytic space without passing through a
construction, and a construction named as the route it arrives by explains nothing a guard can check
— this paragraph used to name `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.sigma`, and used to add
that a definition whose body is a bare analytic space read as a type lists the axiom too, which
named no declaration. **What the guards below record is that nothing here adds an axiom of its
own.** `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.fiberSigmaDescEquiv` is where that could have gone
wrong: it is noncomputable because `Equiv.ofBijective` is — planted without the modifier, the
elaborator names `Equiv.ofBijective` — and `Equiv.ofBijective` carries `Classical.choice` and
nothing else, which is an axiom the guards below print anyway.

/-! ### The clopen part of a cover

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenSubspace.lean` and `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`: that the
inclusion of an open subspace whose carrier is closed is a closed embedding, that it is therefore
finite and finite étale, the composition lemma whose binders are shaped for the comma category, the
complementary open, its carrier and its closedness, and then the cover cut out by a clopen subset
of a cover's total space, its inclusion as a morphism of covers, and the complementary cover.

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_ofRestrict` is guarded in this file — it is the statement
each of these strengthens, and the one the finite étale version reads as its second field — which is
why the open-subspace half is guarded here rather than beside
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofRestrict` itself.

Appended as its own section rather than merged into another, for the reason the sections in this
file give for that: a section appended at the end cannot say which section is above it and stay
true, since the next branch appends between them.

**`Classical.choice` is in every guard below and is introduced by none of them**, and it is there
before any of them builds anything: `#print axioms` at `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` itself lists
it, which the section `### The axiom is already in the structure and in the type of a morphism`
guards. So it reaches every statement about an analytic space without passing through a
construction, and no route named here would be *the* route — this paragraph used to name
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrict`, and used to add that a definition whose body is a bare
analytic space read as a type lists the axiom too, which named no declaration. The sharp case among
the guards below is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.clopenCompl`, whose body is the complement of a
carrier and mentions no `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrict` at all. **What the guards below
record is that nothing here adds an axiom of its own.**

**Noncomputability is a different claim from axiom provenance, and the elaborator does not answer
it with one name.** Planted without the modifier,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.restrictClopen` reports that it depends on
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrict`, while
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.restrictClopenι` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.restrictClopenCompl` report that they depend on
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.restrictClopen`, which is where
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrict` reaches them. This paragraph used to say the elaborator
names `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrict` for each of them.

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Clopen.lean` and `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`: the two-member cover
of an analytic space by a clopen open subspace and its complement, that its members cover and do
not meet, that a morphism out of each member glues to a unique morphism out of the space, the
glued morphism with its two factorisations and the extensionality lemma that is the other half of
its uniqueness, and then — over a base — the complementary part's inclusion, the cocone the two
inclusions make, and that a cover is the coproduct of a clopen part of its total space and the
complementary part.

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_ofRestrict` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.restrictClopen` are guarded in this file, and the
gluing half is guarded here beside them rather than beside
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofRestrict` for the same reason the clopen-part half is.

Appended as its own section rather than merged into another, for the reason the sections in this
file give for that: a section appended at the end cannot say which section is above it and stay
true, since the next branch appends between them.

**`Classical.choice` is in every guard below and is introduced by none of them**, and it is already
present before any of them builds anything: `#print axioms` at `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`
itself lists it, which the section
`### The axiom is already in the structure and in the type of a morphism` guards. It therefore
reaches every declaration stated about an analytic space without passing through any construction,
and no route named here would be *the* route. This paragraph used to add that a `def` whose body is
a bare analytic space read as a type lists the axiom too, which named no declaration. The sharp case
is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.clopenCover`, whose body is a `cond` on two opens and mentions no
construction at all. **What the guards below record is that nothing here adds an axiom of its own**
— `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.descClopen` in particular, which is defined by a choice from

/-! ### The axiom is already in the structure and in the type of a morphism

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Basic.lean`: the structure `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` and the structure
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom`, guarded as declarations in their own right rather than as the
subjects of statements about them.

**The sections `### The fibre functors and finite coproducts`, `### The clopen part of a cover`
and `### Gluing along a clopen pair, and the decomposition of a cover it gives` rest on this, and
until taxis #1800 they rested on prose.** Each says that `Classical.choice` is in every guard below
it and is introduced by none of them, and each gives as its reason that `#print axioms` at
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` already lists it, and each cites this section by heading, so a
rewording of one has this section in front of it. That reason is the whole content of the repair
taxis #1795 made to the sections naming `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.sigma` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrict` — it is why a construction named as the route the axiom
arrives by explains nothing — and at `c32b4c2` no file in this repository printed the axioms of the
structure, so the claim those paragraphs were rebuilt on was carried by prose in the file whose
instrument could have pinned it.

**The structure guard settles the claim on its own.** `#print axioms` reports the axioms reached
through a declaration's transitive dependencies, so a declaration whose type or body mentions
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` cannot list fewer axioms than the structure does. A guard stated
about an analytic space therefore inherits the axiom rather than introducing it, which makes those
paragraphs' claim a consequence of the guard below rather than a second measurement.

**`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom` is guarded beside it, and it is why this section is here
rather than in `OkaTest/Axioms/AnalyticSpace.lean`.** This file's subject is the classes of
morphisms, and the type a morphism of analytic spaces belongs to is where the same transitivity
reaches every statement in it. **A later seat who reads a guard at the structure as belonging with
the objects moves one guard**, and nothing in this section's prose depends on where it sits; the
formula and the reason are the section `### A bijective base, or degree one, makes a local
isomorphism an isomorphism`'s.

**What was dropped rather than pinned.** Those paragraphs also said the axiom is listed by a
definition whose body is a bare analytic space read as a type. That named no declaration. The
nearest thing to one in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Basic.lean` is the anonymous `CoeSort` instance, whose
machine-made name `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.instCoeSortType` is derived from its type, which
is the reason the section `### A bijective base, or degree one, makes a local isomorphism an
isomorphism` gives for not guarding an anonymous instance. Writing a `def` of that shape
into `OkaTest/` for a guard to point at was the other option; it buys nothing the structure guard
does not already give, by the transitivity above, and it would add a declaration to this
repository for a docstring's sake. So the clause is gone from those paragraphs rather than

/-! ### The clopen image of a finite local isomorphism, and the direct summand it cuts out

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalIso.lean` and `Oka/AnalyticSpace/DirectSummand.lean`: that the image of a
finite local isomorphism is clopen, in both the two-field and the class spelling; that the
underlying morphism of a morphism of covers is finite étale over a Hausdorff total space; and the
direct-summand statement that reads a morphism of covers injective on points as one leg of a binary
coproduct.

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isClopen_range_of_isLocalIso_of_isFinite` was the anonymous
`IsClopen` constructor that `IsClopen.eq_univ` was applied to inside
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.surjective_base_of_isLocalIso_of_isFinite`'s proof and is now a
statement of its own; that theorem is guarded in the section
`### Surjectivity of a finite local isomorphism over a connected base`, and the two are guarded in
different sections.

**`Classical.choice` is in every guard below for the reason the section
`### The clopen part of a cover` gives** — `#print axioms` at `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`
itself lists it, so it reaches every statement about an analytic space without passing through any
construction — and not because anything here chooses a witness. **What the guards below record is
that nothing here adds an axiom of its own**, and in particular that the direct-summand statement
introduces none, its existential being witnessed by a named construction rather than by a choice.

Appended as its own section rather than merged into another, for the reason the sections in this
file give for that: a section appended at the end cannot say which section is above it and stay
true, since the next branch appends between them.

/-! ### The terminal object and the product of two complex affine spaces

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/AffineProduct.lean`: that `ℂ^0` is terminal in `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`,
that `ℂ^(n+m)` with its two coordinate projections is the binary product of `ℂ^n` and `ℂ^m`, and
the pair, the two triangles and the uniqueness that make it one.

**`Classical.choice` is in every guard of this section and none of it is this section's
subject.**
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.homComplexAffineSpaceEquivGeneral` is `Equiv.ofBijective`, so its
inverse is a choice term, and every construction guarded here is built through that inverse; the
axiom also reaches `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` itself, for the reason the section
`### The clopen part of a cover` gives. **What the guards record is that nothing in that file adds
an axiom of its own**, and in particular that neither limit is obtained by choosing a witness that
the universal property does not name.

**`CategoryTheory.Limits.HasTerminal ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` is a synthesis result this
push changes**, which is why the instance is guarded here beside the `IsTerminal` term it is built
from: the term says which object is terminal and the instance says only that one is, and a guard
on one is not a guard on the other.

/-! ### The product of two open subspaces of complex affine spaces

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/AffineProductOpen.lean`: that the open subspace of `ℂ^(n+m)` at
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.affineProdOpens` is the binary product of an open subspace of
`ℂ^n` and one of `ℂ^m`, the two legs, the pair, the two triangles and the uniqueness that make it
one, and the base maps of the two coordinate projections of `ℂ^(n+m)` and of the pair into it.

**`Classical.choice` is in every guard of this section and none of it is this section's
subject.** Every construction here is built through
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftRestrict` over
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.affineProdLift`, and the latter goes through the inverse of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.homComplexAffineSpaceEquivGeneral`, which is `Equiv.ofBijective`
and so a choice term; the axiom also reaches `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` itself, for the
reason the section `### The clopen part of a cover` gives. What the guards record is that nothing
in that file adds an axiom of its own.

**The guard on `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.affineProdOpensIsoProd` tests instance search and
not only axiom provenance.** That declaration's statement is written against the `⨯` notation,
which is a `CategoryTheory.Limits.limit` and does not elaborate at all unless
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasBinaryProduct_restrict_complexAffineSpace` is found; so the
guard fails to build if the instance exists and is not reachable by search. That an instance of
this corner of the tree can exist and not be found is not hypothetical:
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isIso_stalkMap_ofRestrict`'s docstring records a Mathlib instance
that is `rfl`-equal to the one wanted and sits at a different discrimination-tree key, and exists
to close exactly that gap.

This section is appended as its own section because a section moved is a conflict for somebody
else. -/

/-! ### The binary product of two local models

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/CutOutProduct.lean`: that the zero locus, inside
`ℂ^(n+m)|affineProdOpens V W`, of two families of holomorphic functions pulled back along the two
legs is the binary product of the two local models they cut out — the object, the two
projections, the pair, the two triangles and the uniqueness that make it one — together with the
mapping property of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOut` in the shape a morphism of analytic
spaces has it.

**Two guards of this section are not on declarations of that file.**
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom.pullbackΓ_comp` lives in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Basic.lean`,
beside the `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom.pullbackΓ` it is about, because it is a statement
about pulling a global section back along a composite and mentions neither a product nor a cut
out; and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom.pullbackΓ` itself is guarded because naming it in
that file's `## Main results` is what put it in `scripts/guard_coverage.py`'s advertised list,
where an unguarded name is a gap. Both are morphisms of analytic spaces, which is the
row `OkaTest/Axioms.lean`'s routing table sends to this file.

**`Classical.choice` is in every guard of this section and none of it is this section's
subject.** `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.lift`, which the projections and the pair are all built
through, goes through `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.baseLift`, whose underlying map is chosen point
by point out of `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.mem_range_base`; the ambient legs go through
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.affineProdLift` and so through `Equiv.ofBijective`; and the axiom
also reaches `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` itself, for the reason the section
`### The clopen part of a cover` gives. What the guards record is that nothing in that file adds
an axiom of its own.

**The guard on `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutIsoProd` tests instance search and not
only axiom provenance**, for the reason the section
`### The product of two open subspaces of complex affine spaces` gives of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.affineProdOpensIsoProd`: the statement is written against the `⨯`
notation, which is a `CategoryTheory.Limits.limit` and does not elaborate at all unless
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasBinaryProduct_ofCutOut` is found.

/-! ### Base change of a covering map, and of its finite fibres

`Oka/Topology/Covering/Basic.lean`'s two statements about `Function.Pullback`:
`IsCoveringMap.pullback_snd`, that a covering map stays one under base change along a *continuous*
map, and `Function.Pullback.finite_fiber_snd`, that the fibres stay finite with no covering
hypothesis and no topology.

**They are mirror-tree topology, and at the commit that adds them no file under `Oka/` outside the
one that declares them names either**, which is the footing `IsCoveringMap.isClosedMap_of_comp` is
already on in the section `### Cancellation of finiteness and of finite étaleness` above, and the
reason both are guarded here: a declaration no other guard reaches through a consumer is the one
whose disappearance nothing else would catch. `Function.Pullback.finite_fiber_snd` is consumed at
that commit by `TwoIndiscrete.not_isCoveringMap_pullback_snd_of_not_continuous`, which is a
declaration of a test file and so is not in this file's environment either. The placement is the
one `OkaTest/Axioms.lean` prescribes for a mirror-tree module whose subject no row of its topic
table names — guard it with the analytic topic it serves — and that file names
`Oka/Topology/Covering/Basic.lean` as its own precedent for the practice. The topic here is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_coveringSpaceHom`, the `morphisms of analytic spaces` row.

**The witness that `IsCoveringMap.pullback_snd`'s continuity hypothesis cannot be dropped is
`TwoIndiscrete.not_isCoveringMap_pullback_snd_of_not_continuous` (`OkaTest/CoveringBaseChange.lean`)
and is not guarded here**, for the reason the section
`### Cancellation of finiteness and of finite étaleness` gives of its own witness: this file imports
`Oka` and not `OkaTest`, so no declaration of a test file is in its environment.

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleBaseChange.lean`. **A limit and not a class**, in the sense
`### That restriction is a pullback square, and the base change it gives` uses of itself: what is
guarded here is that a particular square is a pullback in `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`, and the
one statement about a class — `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_baseChangeSnd`, with
its `CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback` spelling
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_pullback_snd_of_isFiniteEtale` — is a base change of
`isFiniteEtale` and is reached by this file's opening description.

**Three of the guards below are of the mirror tree's shape and are here rather than in
`OkaTest/Axioms/Sheaves.lean`**: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isIso_toInverseImage_of_isLocalIso`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.inverseImageIsoOfIsLocalIso` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.inverseImageIsoOfIsLocalIso_inv_base_apply` are about
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.inverseImage`, but they hypothesise
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso` and are declared in
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleBaseChange.lean`, so `OkaTest/Axioms.lean`'s rule routes them by the
module that declares them and that module is analytic.

**`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasPullback_of_isFiniteEtale` is guarded here as a test of an
instance and not only of a theorem's axioms**, for the reason
`### That restriction is a pullback square, and the base change it gives` gives of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_pullback_snd_ofRestrict`: the statement of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale_pullback_snd_of_isFiniteEtale` mentions
`CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback` at `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` and does not elaborate at all
unless that instance is found by search.

**The two equation lemmas generated by
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChangeFstLRS` and by
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.baseChangeLiftLRS` are not guarded**, which follows this
repository's convention for equation lemmas rather than being an omission — the section of
`OkaTest/Axioms/Sheaves.lean` that guards
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.inverseImage_hom_ext` names the equation lemmas that
`Oka/Geometry/RingedSpace/LocallyRingedSpace/InverseImage.lean` carries and says that `git grep`
finds a `#print axioms` for none of them.

This section is appended as its own section because a section moved is a conflict for somebody
else. -/

/-! ### The fibre product of two local models over a third

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/CutOutFibreProduct.lean`: that the zero locus, inside the binary product of two
local models, of the `p` differences of the two composites to `ℂ^p` is their fibre product over a
third — the object, the two projections, the induced morphism, the two triangles and the
uniqueness that make it one — together with the mapping property of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.zeroLocusSubspace` in the shape a morphism of analytic spaces has
it. **A limit and not a class**, in the sense
`### That restriction is a pullback square, and the base change it gives` uses of itself: no
statement guarded below carries any class of morphisms across the square.

**Which clause of the description at the head of that file reaches which guard below**, said
rather than left to a reader. *Two mapping properties* reaches
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_restrict_complexAffineSpace`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.zeroLocusSubspaceLift`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.zeroLocusSubspaceLift_comp` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_zeroLocusSubspace`; *the two composites to `ℂ^p`* and *the
cutting family* reach `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.toAffineOfCutOut` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.eqCutFamily`; *the object* reaches
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOut`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOutι`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOutFst`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOutSnd`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOutFst_eq` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOutSnd_eq`; *the square commutes* reaches
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.pullbackΓ_eqCutFamily_fibreProdCutOutι` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOut_condition`; *the lift* reaches
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.pullbackΓ_prodCutOutLift_eqCutFamily`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOutLift`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOutLift_ι`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOutLift_fst` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOutLift_snd`; *uniqueness* reaches
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_fibreProdCutOutι` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_fibreProdCutOut`; and the limit itself reaches
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.pullbackConeFibreProdCutOut`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLimitPullbackConeFibreProdCutOut`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isPullback_fibreProdCutOut`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasPullback_ofCutOut` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOutIsoPullback`. Four plus two plus six plus two plus
five plus two plus five is twenty-six, and twenty-six is what is below.

**`Classical.choice` is in every guard of this section and none of it is this section's
subject**, for the reason `### The binary product of two local models` gives of its own guards:
`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.lift`, which the mapping properties and the induced morphism are all
built through, chooses a point out of `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.mem_range_base`, and the axiom
also reaches `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` itself. What the guards record is that nothing in
that file adds an axiom of its own.

**The guard on `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOutIsoPullback` tests instance search
and not only axiom provenance**, for the reason `### The binary product of two local models`
gives of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutIsoProd`: the statement is written against
`CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback`, which is a `CategoryTheory.Limits.limit` and does not elaborate
at all unless `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasPullback_ofCutOut` is found by search. **A scratch
importing `Oka.AnalyticSpace.CutOutProduct`, `Oka.AnalyticSpace.ZeroLocus` and
`Oka.AnalyticSpace.HomToComplex` — the modules that file is built on — and asking for
`CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback a b` at the same cospan reports `failed to synthesize instance of
type class HasPullback a b`**, which is the negative half of that test and was run rather than
assumed.

**`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_restrict_complexAffineSpace` is guarded here although it
mentions no product, no zero locus and no fibre product**, because it is declared in that module
and `OkaTest/Axioms.lean`'s routing table sends a module by what declares it. Its natural home is
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/HomToComplex.lean`, beside
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_complexAffineSpace`, which is guarded in
`OkaTest/Axioms/AnalyticSpace.lean`; that file's docstring says why it is not there yet, and a
push that moves it should move this guard with it.

This section is appended as its own section because a section moved is a conflict for somebody
else. -/

/-! ### A monomorphism of covers is injective on points, and the summand that follows

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/MonoDirectSummand.lean`: that a monomorphism which is finite étale with
Hausdorff source is injective on points, in the two spellings — of a morphism of analytic spaces
and of a morphism of covers — the fibre product of a morphism of covers with itself and its two
projections, and the direct-summand statement with its injectivity hypothesis discharged.

**Which clause of this file's description reaches which guard below**, said rather than left to a
reader. **Three** of the four `Prop` guards below are of the **fourth** kind and are reached by
the clause this file's description acquired in the same push — the one opening *The fourth kind
has a second class, and it is the monomorphisms* — and they are the three whose statements carry
`CategoryTheory.Mono`: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.injective_base_of_mono`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.injective_base_left_of_mono` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.inducesIsoOnDirectSummand_of_mono`. **The fourth,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.injective_base_of_baseChangeFst_eq`, carries no monomorphism**: its
hypotheses are `[ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale i]`, `[T2Space A]` and an equation
between the two projections of the fibre product of `i` with itself, and its own docstring says so
— *The hypothesis is an equation between morphisms and the conclusion is about points*. It is
reached by the opening description's naming of the finite étale class, which is one of the classes
that description lists, and it needs no clause of its own for that reason.

**This paragraph read *The four statements about a monomorphism are of the **fourth** kind and
are reached by the clause this file's description acquired in the same push* until 2026-09-07. It
was false when written rather than falsified later, so this is a correction and not one of this
repository's dated records**: the clause it routes them by reads the kind off
`CategoryTheory.Mono`, and one of the four does not mention it. This is the same shape as this
file's description's own correction, the one whose sentence begins `It said *three* and left`, and
it was found the same way — by reading each guarded statement rather than the section heading.

The other three —
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.selfProd` and its two projections — are an object
of the category of covers and two morphisms of it, and are reached by the description's clause
*the category the finite étale ones form over a fixed base*; the limit that object comes from is
guarded under `### Base change of a finite étale morphism, and the fibre product it is the
projection of` and is not restated here.

**`Classical.choice` is in every guard below** for the reason
`### The clopen part of a cover` gives, and not because anything here chooses a witness: the
existential in the last guard is the one
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.inducesIsoOnDirectSummand_of_injective` already
produces, in the section `### The clopen image of a finite local isomorphism, and the direct
summand it cuts out`, and this statement only supplies its hypothesis.

Appended as its own section rather than merged into that one, for the reason the sections in this
file give: a section appended at the end cannot say which section is above it and stay true.

**Named by file rather than counted**, for the reason this file's other sections give. -/

/-! ### Separatedness of a cover's structure morphism, and the summand it makes free

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedOver.lean`: that a separated morphism into a Hausdorff analytic space
has Hausdorff source, that a descent map out of a disjoint union is separated as soon as each of
its restrictions is, the two consequences of `Oka/AnalyticSpace/MonoDirectSummand.lean` with their
separation axioms supplied by the condition rather than assumed, the direct-summand statement
itself, the three constructions of the category of covers that stay inside the condition, and the
object that does not.

**Which clause of this file's description reaches which guard below.** All but three are reached
by the clause opening *And one kind more*, which is about `IsSeparatedMap` and about the
separation axiom a separated map into a Hausdorff target gives its source.
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.isFiniteEtale_left_of_isSeparatedMap` is of the
first kind — it is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.isFiniteEtale_left`, one of the
cancellations the opening description names, with its `[T2Space]` supplied — and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.injective_base_left_of_mono_of_isSeparatedMap` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver.inducesIsoOnDirectSummand_of_mono_of_isSeparatedMap`
are of the fourth kind's second class, carrying `CategoryTheory.Mono` as three of the four
`Prop` guards of
`### A monomorphism of covers is injective on points, and the summand that follows` do. **That
is the spelling the clause opening *The fourth kind has a second class* uses of the same three**,
and it is used here rather than a count of that section's guards, which are not all of them
`Prop` and not all of them about a monomorphism.

**`Classical.choice` is in every guard below and none of it is this section's subject**, for the
reason `### The clopen part of a cover` gives: the axiom reaches
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` itself, so every statement here carries it whatever its own proof
does.

**`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.not_isSeparatedMap_doubledLineOver` is a negation, and it is
what keeps the rest of this section from being about nothing.**
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.not_isSeparatedMap_doubledLineOver` says the line with two origins
over `ℂ¹` — the object `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Double.lean` built — fails the condition every other
statement here assumes, so the condition is a restriction on the objects of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.FiniteEtaleOver` and not a property they all have. -/

/-! ### The transition data of a fibre product glued over a family of opens

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackBlock.lean`, the whole of it, in the order the declarations are made.
Twenty-seven names.

**The routing, argued rather than assumed, because the module is new.** The topic table at the
head of `OkaTest/Axioms.lean` routes *morphisms of analytic spaces* here. Every declaration below
is a morphism, an equation between two morphisms, or a statement that a morphism is an open
immersion, save for `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.v`, which is an object, and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.isoPullbackFV`, which is an isomorphism — both named only
so that those morphisms can be stated. **All of them are of analytic spaces except the five the
clause at the head of this file names**, which are of `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace`:
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.isOpenImmersion_map_fV`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.isoPullbackFV`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.t'Map`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.t'Map_cocycle` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.t'Map_snd`. **Those five do not route the module
elsewhere, and what says so is the recipe rather than any reading of the table's phrases.** The
recipe `OkaTest/Axioms.lean` gives for measuring a row resolves each `#print axioms` name *to the
module the declaration lives in* and asks whether the row's phrase covers what comes back; every
name below resolves to `Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackBlock.lean`, so the five raise no routing
question separate from the other twenty-two. Inside that module they are stated about images under
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.forgetToLocallyRingedSpace` of what is declared above them, and
exist for nothing but to carry `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.t'` into the category a
glue datum is stated over. **`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.toBase` is not among them and
is a morphism of analytic spaces**, which is what the sentence this replaces got wrong: it named
`toBase` as an object or an isomorphism and swept the other four of the five into *a morphism of
analytic spaces, an equation between two such*, contradicting the clause at the head of this file
that the same push wrote.

**One row worth weighing against it is *general presheaf and sheaf theory, and ringed spaces*,
and it is not answered by reading its phrase.** That row routes `OkaTest/Axioms/Sheaves.lean`,
which gives its own subject as *the presheaved, ringed and locally ringed spaces built out of
them — gluing, open immersions, global sections and germs, …* and which guards statements of kinds
the five are also of: `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.sigma_ι_isOpenImmersion` says that a
morphism of locally ringed spaces is an open immersion, as
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.isOpenImmersion_map_fV` does, and
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.toInverseImage_comp` is an equation between two such. **What
answers it is the module the recipe resolves to**, which is an analytic one and belongs to no
mirror-tree directory. The paragraph in this file headed *Two declarations of
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace` are guarded here* is the harder form of the same question
and its answer covers this one: there, declarations of a module that row *does* route are guarded
here anyway, under the practice `OkaTest/Axioms.lean` states as *"Guard one in the file of the
analytic result that motivated it, under that result's heading"*. Nothing below is a declaration
of a module that row routes.

**Another is *analytic spaces, local models, the node***, which routes `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Glue.lean`
to `OkaTest/Axioms/AnalyticSpace.lean`. That row's own subject line is *Complex analytic spaces as
objects, and the constructions that build one*, and **nothing below is such a construction**.
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.v` is the one declaration below whose result type is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`, and the sentence enumerating the kinds excepts it from the
morphisms as *an object*. But it puts no structure on anything: it names a limit, and **both of
the pullbacks nested in it are supplied from outside this module**. The outer one is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasPullback_ofRestrict`, an instance of
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackOpen.lean`, because its second leg is a
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofRestrict`; the inner one is this file's own hypothesis
`[∀ i, HasPullback (X.ofRestrict (U i) ≫ f) g]`, which nothing in the module discharges.
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofGlueData`, guarded under that row, is what a construction that
builds one looks like. **The join that decides it** is
that the two declarations this module consumes as proof terms,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isOpenImmersion_map_pullbackFst_ofRestrict` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isPullback_map_pullback_pullbackFst_ofRestrict`, are both guarded in
this file, under the heading
*That restriction is a pullback square, and the base change it gives*.

**That row's answer read *that row is about building an analytic space, and nothing below builds
one* until 2026-09-08.** lana-agents/oka#513's verdict recorded that on the plain reading the same
section's own concession that `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.v` **is an object** supplies
a counterexample to it — `v` is a `noncomputable def … : AnalyticSpace.{u}` — declined to reject
on it, and supplied the replacement above. Two things were added to that replacement in landing
it. **The instrument is named**: the module has twenty-seven declarations and `v` is the only one
whose result type is an analytic space, which is what makes the negative half checkable rather
than asserted. And **the two nestings are named separately**, because the verdict's parenthetical
had them the other way round — it is the **outer** pullback that
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackOpen.lean` supplies and the **inner** one that this file hypothesises.
**Nothing about the conclusion moved**: the row does not route this module, and what decides that
is the join through `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isOpenImmersion_map_pullbackFst_ofRestrict` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isPullback_map_pullback_pullbackFst_ofRestrict`, not this sentence.

**Nothing generated is guarded, which is this file's convention and not a decision made here**:
`git grep -c '^#print axioms .*_assoc$'` and the same for `.eq_1` both return nothing over
`OkaTest/Axioms/`. The push that adds these twenty-seven adds **thirteen** generated declarations
beside them — nine `_assoc` lemmas from the `@[reassoc]` attributes that Mathlib's copies of these
statements also carry, and four `.eq_1` equation lemmas, for
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.t`, `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.t'`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.isoPullbackFV` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.t'Map`. **Which four is read off the declaration dump and
not inferred from the shape of the definitions**: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.v`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.fV` and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.toBase`
produce none, and 27 + 9 + 4 is the module's whole tab-anchored row count. **No match lemma
appears.**

**Six of the twenty-seven are the only ones that are not Mathlib's text**, and they are
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.toBase`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.isOpenImmersion_map_fV`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.isoPullbackFV`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.t'Map`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.t'Map_cocycle` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.t'Map_snd` — what carries the transition map into the
category `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData` is stated over. The other twenty-one are
`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/Pullbacks.lean`'s block with `𝒰.f i` replaced by
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofRestrict` and the proofs unchanged. -/

/-! ### The category of separated covers, and separatedness as a morphism property

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtale.lean`, the whole of it save the four instances named
below, together with the two composition statements `Oka/Topology/SeparatedMap.lean` gained in the
same push. **Twenty-one names**: separatedness as a `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty` and the two
readings of that definition, the category the property cuts out with `isFiniteEtale`, its
inclusion into the covers, the two projections of an object's defining pair, its terminal object
in both the witness form and the class form, the object this repository already had that the
category throws out, and — over a Hausdorff base — the Hausdorffness of a total space, the two
properties of the underlying morphism of a morphism of the category, the fibre product of a
morphism with itself with its two projections, and the two consequences at a monomorphism **of
this category**.

**The routing, argued rather than assumed, because the module is new.** The topic table at the
head of `OkaTest/Axioms.lean` routes *morphisms of analytic spaces* here, and that is the row.
Every analytic guard below is a property of a morphism of analytic spaces, a morphism of the
category the finite étale ones form over a fixed base, or an object of that category named so that
those morphisms can be stated; the recipe that file gives resolves each of them to
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/SeparatedFiniteEtale.lean` and the row's phrase covers what comes back. **The
competing row is *analytic spaces, local models, the node*, `OkaTest/Axioms/AnalyticSpace.lean`,
and it loses on the same reading `### Separatedness of a cover's structure morphism, and the
summand it makes free` won on**: nothing below is a local model, a chart or a node, and the
subject of every one of them is a morphism or a category of morphisms.

**`IsSeparatedMap.comp` and `IsSeparatedMap.of_comp` are of the mirror tree**, and they arrive by
the same routing as `IsSeparatedMap.t2Space`, the third statement of
`Oka/Topology/SeparatedMap.lean`, which is guarded in this file under
`### The third rung: a finite étale morphism is a covering map`. That section's own docstring
states the rule and it is `OkaTest/Axioms.lean`'s tail: *"Guard one in the file of the analytic
result that motivated it, under that result's heading."* What motivated these two is the module
below, so this is the heading, and they share a section with the analytic statements that consume
them rather than taking one of their own — which is what the head of this file says the guards
carried from `Oka/Topology/Covering/Basic.lean` do. **What consumes each of them is named and
neither is unconsumed**:
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isSeparatedMap_of_comp` is `IsSeparatedMap.of_comp` at a morphism of
analytic spaces, and the composition statement is spent twice — once in the
`CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.IsStableUnderComposition` instance and once on the structure
morphism of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.selfProd`.

**Four declarations of that module are guarded nowhere and that is this repository's practice for
the `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty` closure instances, not an omission.** They are the four
instances that make separatedness a `CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.IsMultiplicative` property
closed under isomorphism — `instIsStableUnderCompositionIsSeparatedMap`,
`instContainsIdentitiesIsSeparatedMap`, `instIsMultiplicativeIsSeparatedMap` and
`instRespectsIsoIsSeparatedMap` in the `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` namespace, none of them
written with a name. **The precedent is exact and is the property this one is defined beside**:
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean` declares the same four instances for
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFiniteEtale`, they appear in `scripts/DumpOkaDecls.lean`'s output
as `instIsStableUnderCompositionIsFiniteEtale`, `instContainsIdentitiesIsFiniteEtale`,
`instIsMultiplicativeIsFiniteEtale` and `instRespectsIsoIsFiniteEtale`, and **no `#print axioms`
line in `OkaTest/` names any of the four**: `git grep -nE '^#print axioms .*inst.*IsFiniteEtale$'
-- OkaTest/` is empty, and its pattern matches a superset of the four, so an empty result covers
every one of them. **It is anchored at `^#print axioms` and not run against the bare names
precisely so that this paragraph cannot falsify it**: a bare-name grep over `OkaTest/` matches the
two lines above that spell the names out — lines this section adds — and would report the opposite
of what it was asked, while a line of a `/-! -/` block cannot begin at column 0 with
`#print axioms`.

**What that practice is bounded by is the shape and not anonymity**, because of anonymous
instances in general it is false: `OkaTest/Axioms/LocalOkaRing.lean` guards five —
`LocalOkaRing.instIsNoetherianRing`, `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.instIsNoetherianRingStalk`,
`LocalOkaRing.instUniqueFactorizationMonoid`, `LocalOkaRing.instIsRegularLocalRing` and
`LocalOkaRing.instFaithfullyFlat`. Those instantiate algebraic structure on a ring, which is the
subject the file guarding them is about; the four here assert closure of a
`CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty` under composition and identities, which is a property of the
property whose named consequences this section already guards.

So the module's dump contributes twenty-three rows and this section guards **nineteen** of them,
and the four are the whole of the difference; the section's other two guards are
`IsSeparatedMap.comp` and `IsSeparatedMap.of_comp`, which are of the mirror tree and are rows of
`Oka.Topology.SeparatedMap`, as the paragraph above says.

**Which kind each guard is, against the description at the head of this file. All twenty-one are
named and the five counts sum to twenty-one.**

**Seven** are of the kind the head's clause opens with *And one kind more* — a morphism's
underlying map being, or failing to be, a separated map, and the separation axiom on its source
that a separated map into a Hausdorff target gives:
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isSeparatedMap`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isSeparatedMap_iff`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isSeparatedMap_of_comp`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isSeparatedMap_hom`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isSeparatedMap_left`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.t2Space_left` — which is that clause's
second half, the separation axiom the hypothesis gives — and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.not_inf_isSeparatedMap_doubledLineOver`, which is its *failing to
be* half at a named object.

**Two** are of the **seventh**, the mirror tree: `IsSeparatedMap.comp` and
`IsSeparatedMap.of_comp`. **By subject they are of the kind above as well**, and they are counted
here and not there because the seventh kind is *a kind of routing rather than a kind of subject*
in the head's own words, and routing is the question a guard file's placement answers; the
paragraph above argues that routing.

**Five** are of the **first**, by the description's clause naming the category the finite étale
ones form over a fixed base together with the cancellations that make a morphism of it finite
étale: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isFiniteEtale_hom`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.isFiniteEtale_left`, and the fibre product
of a morphism with itself together with its two projections,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.selfProd`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.selfProdFst` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.selfProdSnd` — which is where
`### A monomorphism of covers is injective on points, and the summand that follows` puts the three
of that shape it holds, and the head of this file says so of them.

**Two** are of the **fourth**, by the clause opening *The fourth kind has a second class, and it is
the monomorphisms*:
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.injective_base_left_of_mono` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.SeparatedFiniteEtaleOver.inducesIsoOnDirectSummand_of_mono`. **Their
`CategoryTheory.Mono` is in this category and not in the covers**, which is what they are for.

**Five** are of the **sixth**, about the category rather than about any morphism in it, and the
head of this file names all five.

/-! ### The image of an open-subspace inclusion, and of a base change of one

**Two names, of two modules**: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.range_base_ofRestrict` is
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenSubspace.lean`'s and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.range_base_pullbackFst_ofRestrict` is
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackOpen.lean`'s. The first says the image of the inclusion of an open
subspace is that open subset; the second says the image of the first projection out of the
pullback along such an inclusion is the preimage of the open subset, which is the second half of
what `Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackOpen.lean` says about that projection — the first half being
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isOpenImmersion_map_pullbackFst_ofRestrict`, guarded above under
`### That restriction is a pullback square, and the base change it gives`.

**The routing, argued rather than assumed.** The topic table at the head of `OkaTest/Axioms.lean`
routes *morphisms of analytic spaces* here, and the subject of both is the underlying map of a
morphism — where it lands. **The competing row is *analytic spaces, local models, the node*,
`OkaTest/Axioms/AnalyticSpace.lean`**, which is where `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrict` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofRestrict` themselves are guarded, and it loses on the same
reading that puts `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLocalIso_ofRestrict` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isIso_stalkMap_ofRestrict` in this file rather than beside them:
the open subspace is the *space*, and a statement about what its inclusion does is about the
*morphism*. Neither of the two below names a local model, a chart or a node.

**The first is not a duplicate of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.base_ofRestrict`, which is not
guarded anywhere.** That one computes the map at a point and is `rfl`; this one computes the image
of the whole source, which is the form a factorisation hypothesis takes —
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftRestrict` and
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion.lift` both ask for a range containment and
neither can be fed a point computation. **That `…base_ofRestrict` is unguarded is a fact about
this file and not an argument**: `scripts/guard_coverage.py` counts it among the declarations no
`## Main results` advertises, and this section adds no guard for it.

**Nothing generated is guarded and neither push generated anything.** The two modules' tab-anchored
row counts in `scripts/DumpOkaDecls.lean`'s output rise by exactly one each: no `_assoc` lemma, no
`.eq_1` equation lemma, no match lemma and no congruence lemma. **One match lemma was avoided
rather than absent** — `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.range_base_ofRestrict` was first written
with a destructuring `fun ⟨y, hy⟩ ↦ …`, which generated one, and its own docstring records why it
is `Subtype.range_val` instead. Equation lemmas are generated on demand, so both sentences are
about the environment at the commit that adds this section.

**What consumes each of them is named and neither is unconsumed.**
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.range_base_pullbackFst_ofRestrict` is spent once, in
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.range_base_ι` — the image computation that replaces
Mathlib's `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Pullback.pullbackP1Iso` — and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.range_base_ofRestrict` is spent once, inside the proof of the
other. Both are guarded here and the consumer is guarded in
`OkaTest/Axioms/AnalyticSpace.lean`, under that file's heading beginning
*The gluing is the fibre product* — spelled without backticks here because the heading itself
carries a backticked name; that section argues its own routing and says why these two are not
there with it. -/
