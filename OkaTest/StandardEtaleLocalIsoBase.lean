# The `k ≥ 1` witness for the standard étale local isomorphism over a presented base

`ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_analytificationMap_etalePresHom`
(`Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleLocalIsoBase.lean`) is stated at every `k`, and until this file
it had no instance at `k ≥ 1`. That file's own `## What is not here` says so and names the cheapest
route:

> **No `k ≥ 1` instance is exhibited, so the new content of the last theorem is unwitnessed.** …
> The cheapest would be `ComplexAnalytic.sqSubOnePair` (`OkaTest/OpenBaseFiniteness.lean`), which
> is a `StandardEtalePair` over an **arbitrary** commutative ring and so over a presented algebra
> at any `k`: **an instantiation and not a construction**, and this file does not make it.

It is right about the route, and `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_node`
is that instantiation. **What the route does not say is that the cheapest pair's cover is an
isomorphism**, which is why there are two witnesses here and not one.

## The base is the node, and `g = ![0]` would have witnessed the index rather than the content

The base is `ComplexAnalytic.nodeG`, that is `n = 2`, `k = 1`, `ℂ[x, y]/(xy)`.

**A `k ≥ 1` presentation of `ℂ^n` would prove nothing.** Both `g = ![]` and `g = ![0]` present
`ℂ^n`, so an instance at either would exhibit the *index* `k ≥ 1` and not the content: the whole
difference between this theorem and the `k = 0` one is that the target is `X^an` rather than
`ℂ^n`, and at those two they are the same space.

**The node is a base at which the two `k ≥ 1` statements come apart**, which is the property the
library file's argument turns on. `Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleLocalIso.lean` argues that the
*other* `k ≥ 1` statement — the same morphism followed by `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationInclHom`
— is false *"whenever `X^an` is a proper non-empty closed subset of `ℂ^n`, since its image is the
whole of `X^an` and a local isomorphism has open image"*, and it says in terms that neither
qualification follows from `k ≥ 1`: at `g = 0` the image is the whole of `ℂ^n`. The node's zero
locus is proper and non-empty, so it is inside that argument's hypotheses and `g = ![0]` is not.
**Nothing below proves that composite is not a local isomorphism** — see `## What is not checked
here`; the claim made is only that the witness sits where the question is live.

## Two pairs, because the cheapest one is an isomorphism

* `ComplexAnalytic.sqSubOnePair` is `f = X² − 1`, `g = X − 1`. Its own file proves
  `ComplexAnalytic.sqSubOnePair_X : (sqSubOnePair R).X = -1` — both relations are used — and
  builds `ComplexAnalytic.sqSubOneRingEquiv` out of it, so **the standard étale algebra is the
  base**. The morphism the first witness is about is therefore an isomorphism, and a local
  isomorphism for a reason the theorem does not need.
* `ComplexAnalytic.sqSubOneTwoPair` is `f = X² − 1`, **`g = 2`**. Inverting `2` changes nothing
  over a `ℂ`-algebra, so the algebra is `R[X]/(X² − 1)` — two sheets, and not the base.

**`g = 2` and not `g = 1`, and the difference is a `1/2`.** With `g = 1` the `cond` field asks for
`derivative f * p₁ + f * p₂ = 1`, which needs `2` inverted in the coefficients and so a
`ℂ`-algebra hypothesis on `R`. With `g = 2` it asks for `2` on the right, and
`2X · X + (X² − 1)(−2) = 2` is an identity over **any** commutative ring — which is the same
economy `ComplexAnalytic.sqSubOnePair` records for its own `cond`, where the avoidable `1/2` is
called out in that file's docstring.

## The lifts, and the one place `simp` does not close on its own

`ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_analytificationMap_etalePresHom` asks for `F` and `G` in the new
variable together with `hF` and `hG` identifying their classes with the pair's `f` and `g` through
`ComplexAnalytic.polyPresentedAlgebraEquiv`. For `F = Z² − 1` and `G = Z − 1` both are `simp`:
`ComplexAnalytic.polyPresentedAlgebraEquiv_mk_X_var` gives the variable and the ring-hom lemmas
give the rest, with `ComplexAnalytic.sqSubOnePair_f` and `ComplexAnalytic.sqSubOnePair_g` on the
other side. **For `G = 2` it is `map_ofNat` twice and not `simp`** — the numeral has to be carried
through `Ideal.Quotient.mk` and then through the equivalence, and neither step is a `simp` lemma
in this configuration.

**Every definition below is unfolded by a `show … from rfl` and never by naming it to `simp`, and
the difference is measurable.** A draft that wrote `simp [nodeEtaleF, nodeEtaleG, nodeG, …]` put
**five** auto-generated equation lemmas into this module's row of
`scripts/DumpOkaDecls.lean` — one for each of the four definitions here **and
`ComplexAnalytic.nodeG.eq_1`, for a definition `OkaTest/Analytification.lean` owns**, which is the
one worth avoiding: a delta-unfold plants the equation lemma in the module that does the
unfolding, not in the module that made the definition. With the `show`s the module contributes
exactly its twelve declarations and `grep -E 'eq_1|match_'` over them is empty. This is the same
economy `ComplexAnalytic.sqSubOnePair_f`'s docstring buys with a named `rfl` lemma; a `show` is
the cheaper form where only one proof needs the unfolding.

## Neither space is empty, which is the half a reader cannot take on trust

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsLocalIso` of a morphism whose source is empty is not obviously
false, so a witness that exhibits no point is one a reader cannot tell from a vacuity. That is
taxis #1196's species — *"nothing says `localisationOpen …` is ever non-empty, so
`ComplexAnalytic.etaleAnalytificationIso` could be an isomorphism of empty spaces"* — and both
ends are exhibited below:

* the **base** by `nodeOrigin`, through `ComplexAnalytic.analytification_nodeG`, which is `rfl`;
* the **source** by the tuple `(0, 0, 1, 1/2)` of `ℂ⁴`, whose three relations evaluate to `0 · 0`,
  `2⁻¹ · 2 − 1` and `1 − 1`.

**On the import of `OkaTest.OpenSubspace`.** It is for one named witness, `nodeOrigin`, which is
the reason `OkaTest/HolomorphicMapGeneral.lean` gives for the same edge. Re-deriving the origin
here would be a second copy of a definition this repository already owns, and this project has
spent branches retiring duplicates of exactly that shape.

**And that name is unqualified on purpose.** `OkaTest/OpenSubspace.lean` opens no `namespace`, so
`nodeOrigin` is in the root namespace and prefixing it with this file's own namespace names
nothing. `scripts/check_docstring_names.py` is what says so, and it said it about a draft of this
file: everything else cited here is under `ComplexAnalytic`, which is what makes the one bare name
read as a typo rather than as the fact it is. **The prefixed form is not written out above because
the checker reads this paragraph too** — a docstring cannot quote the name it is explaining is
absent, which is the second thing that draft learned.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.sqSubOneTwoPair`: **the pair `f = X² − 1`, `g = 2`**, over an arbitrary
  commutative ring — the second witness's pair, whose algebra is not the base.
- `ComplexAnalytic.nodeEtaleF`, `ComplexAnalytic.nodeEtaleG` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.nodeEtaleGSubOne`: the lifts `Z² − 1`, `2` and `Z − 1` in the new variable.
- `ComplexAnalytic.nodeEtalePt`: the tuple `(0, 0, 1, 1/2)`, a point of the second witness's
  source.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_node`: **the `k ≥ 1` witness**, at
  the node and at `ComplexAnalytic.sqSubOneTwoPair`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.isLocalIso_analytificationMap_etalePresHom_node_sqSubOne`: the same at
  `ComplexAnalytic.sqSubOnePair`, which is the instantiation
  `Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleLocalIsoBase.lean` names as cheapest — and whose cover is the
  base.
- `ComplexAnalytic.nonempty_analytification_nodeG`: **the base is not empty.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.eval_etalePresentation_nodeEtalePt` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.nonempty_analytification_etalePresentation_node`: **the source is not empty**,
  so neither witness is a statement about an empty space.

## What is not checked here

* **Nothing about how many sheets either cover has.** `ComplexAnalytic.sqSubOnePair`'s algebra is
  the base — that is `ComplexAnalytic.sqSubOneRingEquiv`'s statement and it is quoted here, not
  reproved — and `ComplexAnalytic.sqSubOneTwoPair`'s is `R[X]/(X² − 1)`, which is **not** shown
  below to be anything other than the base. Two sheets is what the algebra says to a reader and
  not what any declaration here says; proving it, or proving the second cover is not an
  isomorphism, is a separate statement and nothing below attempts it.
* **No proof that the composite with `ComplexAnalytic.analytificationInclHom` fails at this
  base.** `Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleLocalIso.lean` argues that in prose, from a local
  isomorphism having open image and the node having empty interior in `ℂ²`. **The argument is not
  a theorem in this repository**, here or anywhere, and the base above was chosen so that its
  hypotheses hold rather than so that its conclusion is available.
* **Nothing at `k ≥ 2`, and nothing about a general `k`.** Both witnesses are at one presentation
  with one relation. The theorem is general in `k` and this file is evidence that it is
  instantiable, not that it is instantiable uniformly.
* **No finiteness, and so no `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale`.** The finiteness half
  at `k ≥ 1` does not exist — `Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleFiniteEtale.lean` and
  `Oka/Analytification/StandardEtaleFiniteness.lean` both record it absent — and unrestricted
  finiteness is false, with the counterexample in `Oka/Analytification/MonicHypersurface.lean`.
* **No `#print axioms` guard.** `OkaTest/Axioms/` guards declarations of the `Oka` library;
  nothing below is one. `ComplexAnalytic.condPair` and `ComplexAnalytic.sqSubOnePair`, the two
  standard étale pairs this repository already has, are unguarded for the same reason.
